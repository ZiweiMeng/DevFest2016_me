"This may be the definition of the perfect beach! Great for singles to walk aimlessly and for families as well. Lovely sand, ample parking..... Just perfect! Don't forget to stop by for sunset !"
Took the trolly to this little town at the end of the island and loved it!! We will be back in for another visit and possibly to stay in town!
"Pass-a-Grille is a quaint little beach town at the southernmost end of St. Pete Beach. Certainly can understand why people rave about it: low key, laid back, charming and the way Florida used to be! Lovely view of the bay and Gulf of Mexico from the roof of the imposing Hurricane restaurant! Not a lot of touristy places or high-rise..."
"Love this sleepy beach town. Traveled mid week in late January. We had one beautiful weather day, one drizzly foggy day but both were perfect."
"small area, pleasant, quaint, charm, beach. South of the Don Cesar. Good for bike riding except that some of the road is under construction (Dec 2015-Jan 2016). Nice sunset on the beach, sunrise on the bay. Quaint boutique hotels"
"Love this place so much we are returning in April and we have never vacationed in the same place twice. Everything you need is within walking distance. Great beach, friendly local restaurants, quaint shops. Almost don't want to give it good review and keep it all to ourselves!"
"Pass-a-Grille has a lot of history. It has very little beach and too much tourism... Never a place to park, so take a bike, walk or trolley. I can not really recommend a fantastic restaurant there. Most places are bar food or just not the best...The shops are very over priced. It is a cute place to take a walk..."
Fun area but we do drive there but well worth the drive. We stop there at least one every year. The Wrarf is a good place to go.
"If you don't believe the Title, just drive by on Gulf Way. The only building on the beach side is a Kiosk with bar and grill called ""Paradise Grill"". But that is far from what impresses. Miles long of beautiful, clean, white beach, beautiful blue-green crystal clear water, and the surf rolling in creating a melody of peace and tranquility...."
Pass-a-grille is old school St Pete. I went to high school in St Pete and this was our beach. Basketball court across the street. Great beach walking. Go get a grouper sandwich at the Hurricane.
"We have been to 2 weddings at Sunny Hill in the past 5 years, one in early May and the other at the end of October (this past weekend). Lovely place especially in the fall. The wedding was done on the hill overlooking the beautiful valley/ mountains. Very rustic feel. The hall where the reception was held has a full..."
I have been going with my son on and off for 16 years. He is a teen now and STILL enjoys Sunny hill. It is a beautiful setting. The grounds are beautiful. There are rooms to suit all needs and wants. All the rooms are immaculate. The Nicholsen family continually reinvests in and improves their property all the time. It...
"Spent a couple of days this week here as the result of winning a gift certificate. My wife and I recently retired and pickrd this week to visit. A motel style room, a little dated but clean and comfy. 3 simple meals a day and all the golf you can play."
We won a stay and play three day all inclusive
"This place was amazing. Plenty for the kids to do, beautiful golf course, wonderful scenery, and best of all gentle on the budget. Everything is clean and the people that work there are very accommodating. We plan on making this a family tradition."
"We won a 2-night golf stay at Sunny Hill and stayed over Labor Day Weekend. Although this is primarily a family resort where many have come for generations, we were able to stay at the Thunderhart golf course where there were mostly adults. The accommodations were basic but the entire resort was exceptionally clean and all activities and meals were..."
"Once again Sunny Hill did not disappoint. Golf, basketball, shuffleboard, volleyball, lawn bowling, fishing, the Viking Obstacle Course and plenty of fun by the pool. This year, there was even some antiquing involved in some of the local surroundings. I've said it before but I'll say it again, Sunny Hill is by far the most relaxing vacation one can take...."
"Only spent a couple nights at sunny hill for the first time but it was long enough to know that this is a unique and amazing place and we will be back next year for a longer stay. The activities are endless and you can do as much or little as you like. Children absolutely loved the fishing, several playgrounds..."
"Great place to relax and unwind with the family, everyone is so friendly and nice to be around. This place is truly a wonderful place to go on a good family vacation with also wonderful golfing experience. The only con is it has a bad gym... Very tiny with not much to offer"
It's a great way to see the park and very good value for money. The carriage driver give a very good history guide and tell you who live where is the surrounding apartment blocks
"Regardless of the time of year, Central Park is a must see when in New York. Take a carriage ride and take in the sights."
"We had a fabulous time in Central Park, the snow was high and everyone was out to play. Children and adults on sledges and people walking. It was difficult to see the usual features as covered in snow. Such a lovely time to visit New York"
It's the third time we visit central park and on each of our visits to this city we were never able to skip this attraction! It's a great experience for all kind of people not just those with kids or teenagers. Do not miss visiting this landmark and enjoying the diverse attractions.
"Spent a lovely afternoon here cycling around the park. it is surprisingly hilly, however, so I recommend NOT hiring the quaint looking bikes with no gears, no brakes and that feel like they've been made from cast iron. Even the lycra clad pros were struggling up some of the hills, so to do a whole circuit, get one of the..."
"Loved this place! My husband &amp; I were there in December, and we took a Horse &amp; Carriage around roughly a quarter of it (from Columbus Circle). Spent pretty much the whole day around there as had visited the Plaza in the morning, then went to Columbus Circle to the German Markets, and then took our Horse &amp; carriage ride...."
"Central park is beautiful all 4 seasons of the year. Great place to walk, exercise, enjoy live music, etc. and get away from the rush of the city. Always hosting amazing events."
"Went for a walk in Central Park a few days after the big snowfall this January - wow, so beautiful! I saw over a dozen blue jays and cardinals, vibrant against the white blanket of snow and the frozen river. I enjoy the quiet hum of Central Park on a weekday morning on a bright winter day much more than..."
As we arrived when the snow was still there it was a magical view to behold. We were offered a horse and carriage ride but I honestly would stick with the walk.
"Do not miss a stroll through Central Park on your next visit to NYC! Lots to see, people watching amazing and a peaceful get away in the midst of it all. Fun attractions for all ages include skating, The Zoo, Tavern on The Green, Strawberry Fields, The Boat pond, The Carousel and lots of playgrounds."
I spent 2 days with a friend and her kids and they had a blast!
Durrant. Jordan. mark. keivin. Man best service I have ever had. I will definitely come back to the definitely come back to the Trump. They made us feel like kings we felt comfortable everything we needed any question we ask they answered
"We stayed at this hotel with 3 toddlers. We were very demanding on our needs. The service was beyond exceptional. The valet was excellent, the housekeeping was excellent, Mariana at the concierge did an excellent job planning out our days! The beach at the hotel is super, is quite wide in comparison to hotels further south in miami beach. The..."
"Do not check in until February 19th called the hotel 2 times asked to speak to a manager both times told no manager was available was told to leave name &amp; # no one ever returned my call I called 1 week apart nothing then went on website left message , nothing your hotel customer service is terrible and be..."
Trump's people are uncompromising in delivering excellent service and making your stay memorable! This was our fourth visit -- we keep coming back for the beach and relaxation -- everyone helps make it the BEST.
"Our family visited the Trump International Beach Resort in Sunny Isles Beach, Florida from January 2-3, 2016. We really wanted to like this place and we quite excited about our stay. My 7 year old son picked with me it when he recognized the Trump name and I thought we'd give it a try as we have never stayed at..."
I traveled here to watch international soccer teams with my mom and a friend. We booked this hotel just two weeks before heading down. When we arrived our room was not ready but we checked our bags and had full access to the resort. After going to the beach for a bit we came back and our room was ready....
"We stayed here as a family prior to heading up to Orlando and Disneyworld. The room was spacious and well-appointed with a large, luxurious bathroom (always something I look for) and a balcony with a stunning view of the beach/ocean. The beds were also very comfortable. Friendly front-desk staff too, which is always a plus. We would return."
"This is an awesome place to stay. The kids club is great for your little ones, I would say under the age of 9 is best. It's on beach, plus has great pool and food, drinks, etc. rooms were awesome. I would go back in a heartbeat."
"This high line is a renovated, elevated rail track which has been beautifully renovated with plants and trees and enables you to walk through the old meat packing district above street level so no traffic. Go in the evening as it has some great views and is very peaceful, romantic. Of and its free"
"Nice view of the Hudson/stroll on a non-windy day. Best to then descend for eats and local shopping and the lit fountain at Chelsea Market, or a tour of the new Whitney. In winter, don't miss ice skating eight penguins at Gansevoory Market."
Took a free walk up some stairs to see NYC from an elevated railway platform that was turned into a park. I had heard that a group had to fight hard against the developers to keep this from being torn down. A must see while you can. Nature and free does not advertise so take the hint. Loved it!
"Everyone flocks to 30 rock, central park, ground zero, wall street.......THIS needs to be at the top of your list of things to do. After a tour of Chelsea Market with lunch, we easily got on the High Line and walked up to the Hudson Stock Yards. Fantastic sights and scenes along the way while NYC is under you feet...."
Not just enjoyable but also important.
Take a stroll and see the city from a different angle. Imagine what it was like when these rails were bustling with industry. Great way to get from midtown to meatpacking.
Any season is a great season to walk the High Line. It is a fascinating and interesting view of the city and the river. Take time to relax on one of the chaise lounges or overlooking a busy NY street. Bring a picnic from a nearby take out spot and relax. Lots of fun shopping if you start in the...
nuce stroll on thr highline on a sunny day is great. you can srtop for launch at rhe chealsy market or just get a snack and eat on the bench
"Rain or shine, find solace, art, nature and great people watching on the tracks of the high line. Don't imagine that it won't be busy, but granted your worst fear is being run over by a toddler-walked dog-- not a taxi. So put on your shades, a smile and amble enjoyably along."
"Get a view of NYC above the crowds. See the new construction above the train yards. This elevated walkway is fun, free, and sometimes crowded. Musicians sometimes play along the way."
My wife and I booked a snorkel trip with Sunny Days and had an absolute wonderful time. We were taken to two different reef locations to snorkel along with about 10 other people. The trip total time was 3 hours (an hour travel time and 2 hours to snorkel; one hour at each reef location). Sunny Days has a very...
"I love to snorkel and used to dive, but this is sooo much fun. Well planned, comfortable, a very memorable trip I want to do again soon! I saw so many tropical fish, Manta Rays, tours and friendly crew. I was never on a fast-cat before and it was great! Dry Tortugas was so interesting with so much history and..."
"Booked the ""double dip"" snokelling excursion. The trip ended up being aborted due to so many jellyfish in the water. After approximately 10 minutes of snorkeling we were rounded up and herded back to the boat. The captain tried several other sites, but no luck finding one without the pesty creatures. I was impressed by the staff, particularly Dave and..."
"We booked a snorkeling trip through their website that would visit two locations in the waters near the island. The boat itself is quite nice and spacious and didn't feel overcrowded at all. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable and made sure that everyone had a nice time. While the reefs that we visited weren't over the top amazing, we..."
"We took this trip a year ago, but my family and I haven't forgotten it! My children still talk about it at least once a week. I can't say enough good things about this tour. Yes, the trip was long and I'll admit that I choked at the price at first, but the trip was worth every dime. The crew..."
"Sunny Days was recommended by our concierge at the Pier House, as I had never snorkeled before. He recommends them for beginner snorkelers, and I fully support his recommendation. The three snorkeling guides were informative without dragging on during their instruction. The boat was spacious, the bathrooms cleanly and easy to use (this was a must for me!), the snorkeling..."
"When another tour boat did not reach its minimum paying guests for the day's trip, we took Sunny Days. I'm glad it worked out that way, as there were only 6 guests (their minimum) for our 9 AM tour to Sand Key and Rock Key. The boat holds about 49 people, but I was glad to have plenty of room..."
We had a wonderful time- the staff was great and really helped us out. We arived late to Key West after driving from Fort Lauderdale (it takes longer than you think!) and missed the dolphin snorkeling cruise we'd booked. The ticket booth staff was super accomodating and put us on the next boat with zero hassle at all. Unfortunately that...
The captain and crew were great. The boat was not overcrowded like so many other catamarans we saw. The boat ride was smooth. Unfortunately my wife got seasick so we spent a little more time on the boat than in the water. The crew took great care of us. The captain sat and talked to us pretty much the whole...
"The Dry Tortugas is beautiful, but I highly recommend you spend the money to fly. The trip over and back with Sunny Days Catamarans on the Fast Cat was nothing short of miserable. The trip was advertised as the ""fastest, most comfortable"" boat ride to the Dry Tortugas, which was why we selected Sunny Days. Based on the cost -..."
"This place is 3 star at the most and there is no question about it. Needs a major overhaul! MAJOR. I believe their intentions are honest, but it's the investment that makes places better."
"The internet is not reliable anywhere in the hotel. We received excuses of the wind, too many guests in the hotel and it only works in the lobby, which it did not."
First off this place is supposed to be a resort but it was far from it the rooms were absolutely disgusting mold everywhere the customer service was even worse believe it or not. Completely ruined our vacation!!
Great location with private beach and pier. Have lunch and drinks at the cabana or on the pier. Clean rooms with ocean views. Friendly staff and helpful staff. Great breakfast buffet and awesome onsite restaurant Kitchen 305. Sit pool side or at the hot tub or reserve
"Don't stay here!! For the price you pay it is not worth it!! The rooms are outdated and filthy. Our tv didn't work, the toilet barely flushed, the carpet was disgusting, cobwebs in the outdated lamps, ect... Super disappointing stay!! Will never go back!"
The hotel is located at very convenient location from everything. We liked the hotel except the cleanness of the hotel. The hotel has direct access to beach. The hotel has heated swimming pool and hot tub.
Had a little mixup that was my fault last night. Anell was able to efficiently fix the booking issue and keep me at my new favorite hotel. The most important part to me is that she genuinely cared. Most of the time people at the front desk of at hotel do a good job. She went above and beyond and...
"Misrepresented on pictures. Their so called traditional rooms were small, dingy and more like motels rather than hotel suites. Poor motel is what this looked like to me. Misrepresented in the pictures they show you. Don't know about these other reviews but my experience was so bad that I got out of there as soon as I can. DO NOT..."
"After reading horrible reviews, I was a little nervous on what to expect. I was, however, pleasantly surprised at this resort. Located right on the beach, it was perfect! Amenities include pool, tiki bar poolside, restaurant and bar, breakfast buffet options, coffee shop and gift shop. Additionally, we had an upgraded ocean front room which was fabulous! Some of the..."
We stayed for 15 days and had a marvelous time. We celebrated Christmas and New Years
I want to first say that I am a very picky traveler and my standards are very high. I chose this hotel based on other reviews and I will try to make mine easy for others out there trying to decide where to stay.
"Stayed at the resort for a long weekend. Did not seem very busy and appeared to be on the north end of things to do. Construction two parcels over was a little annoying but not much you can do about that as a consumer. Grounds we nice, common area inside clean and well kept. Pool area had sand in pool..."
I picked this hotel b/c I thought it would be nice to stay in North Miami away from the crowds of South Beach and my daughter lives in Normandy Isles which is 20mins south. The hotel was very nice and it was very clean. The staff was very friendly and accommodating.
"If you don't mind staying just a little bit out of the way, Sunny Isles Beach is just a little bit north of the tried and true Miami Beach area and offers a luxury experience at a good price. On a recent trip to visit Art Basel (located in Miami and Miami Beach Convention Center) I found the better rate..."
"My wife and I spent 4 nights at the resort and had a great time overall. The staff was A+, the rooms B, clean A, nice views A, noise level B, room set up C (TV was in closet and to use closet it blocks TV). Too large of bathroom and too little bedroom, bad ceiling lighting (there aren't any),..."
"This is a fantastic establishment and I would highly recommend. We stayed in November 2015 and had a wonderful 3 night stay. The check in is smooth and efficient. The rooms (we had a suite) are amazing with great facilities. We had a fully fitted kitchen with hob, oven, dish washer and crockery cutlery provided. Washer/dryer. Two TVs. Large bathroom..."
"Flying in from the west coast, we arrived at the hotel at 1:30 am with 6 bags of luggage. We were surprised to find there was no bellman on duty, only a valet attendant who watched as we struggled with our bags. The hotel itself is showing its age, with pealing wall paper and water damage."
"Stayed here for two nights while travelling. The staff are very helpfull, they allowed me to check in early as my room was all ready which was a nice touch. I had a sea view room which had great views. The room was very clean and comfy. This hotel is great, only negative is the wifi in the room which..."
"The bridge is wonderful, the museum near is very nice for the ones who whant some souvenirs. You can walk, or ride a bike ."
We spent a very pleasant couple of hours admiring the bridge from various angles. We then walked most of the way over the bridge and back again. The bridge is great and well worth a visit. Parking was a slight problem but we found there was free parking in an overflow car park just above the bridge on the south...
One can marvel at the view and the construction all day long. Take a walk with a friend or cycle on it. The waters are beautiful. What more can I say
"Visited with family and friends and hired bikes. Rode from San Francisco over the bridge to Sausalito, it was a highlight of our trip. However, I must warn you, be prepared for hills as there are plenty of them. It's easy to get off your bike and walk though, but don't walk your bike on the bridge, the local riders..."
Ran the bridge in early morning and it was breathtaking. Super windy but was prepared for that and well worth it given the spectacular vista that greets you!
"A must visit and drive over the suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate strait, the one-mile-wide, three-mile-long channel between San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean. The bridge has a major influence on the fog by pushing it up or pours down around it."
"As a tourist, I had a few there would be s toll booth and me with not enough cash. I fond a website that said the toll was $7.50. No toll booth in site on a Sunday and we just sailed on through. The day was clear and the view beautiful."
"It's a bridge. Granted a suspension bridge which is an engineering feat, but it's a bridge. The view from the bridge on a clear day is superb, so don't forget your camera. I walked half way through and back and took plenty of gorgeous pictures of the Bay Area."
"We rented bicycles from the Sports Basement on Old Mason Street. It is very close and they have ample parking for you to leave your car while you take the bike out for the afternoon. I think I paid about $70 for two bicycles for the entire day, which included locks and helmets."
A spectacle ! Nothing in words can describe the experience I had while cycling on the golden gate bridge on a sunny winter day of November.
I been last 5 years in this hotel yearly same room and I liked . This year I hate the mattress as got old . Is noisy and the springs want to get out of the mattress . I can't sleep
"This is touted as a resort. The beach is nice as is the restaurant in the hotel, but the room's furnishings were lackluster and worn out. The bed was comfortable and we slept well. For the cost of this hotel, I would have expected more. Steep daily ""resort fee"" for using the beach, wifi, and the pool. Really!? Stay elsewhere..."
I recently stayed with my family at Sole for the second time and it was just as great as the first time! Sleek and clean exteriors extend from the lobby and into the rooms. The location and views are incredible. The hidden gem though is the in-house restaurant. We grew to know the staff as we dined there several times...
"What a lovely hotel; and the food at FAB is amazing. Caleb was a very accommodating young man, friendly and knowledgeable. The oysters are so good as a starter, and the grouper as an entree. Kristina is a magician making drinks behind the bar. We will definitely be back!"
"I stayed at Sole on the Ocean on Sunny Isles Beach over the weekend. The room was amazing, had a splendid view of the beach and amazing customer service. The best experience was when my weekend was heading for the worst. I lost my car keys on the beach in the sand. I found one of your staff members and..."
"Our visit here was amazing! Very nice workers here like Leonurdo, Manuel, Diego, Grey, Kerry, and jade! We will definitely be coming back! I loved how everyone here was just so nice and respectful and greeted you very nicely! The beach was perfect and the food service was great!"
"Stayed here over the weekend, hotel room and staff were wonderful. Only issue we experienced were the the toilet didn't seem to want to flush, we had to wait in between uses to get it to work. Second was the air didn't seem to circulate to the bedroom even at 50 degrees. But overall won't mind staying again."
"Lovely view, pleasant staff. One plastic (maybe acrylic?) chair to sit in, but great to look at. Nowhere in shower to put anything except the floor, no hook for a towel. Cool design, but would encourage owners/managers to actually sleep there a night. Closets big. Breakfast staff very nice. 601B, maybe other units were better."
"There are many places to walk to nearby. Staff are very friendly and super. Great view to the beach from the restaurants up stairs. The service at the front desk and restaurants was very good. Especially thanks to Pedro, Leila and Kristina for the service. Food was especially delicious. The deserts were amazing and very delicious. We hope to return..."
My wife and I went here for a day visit and enjoyed it. Her being new to the nudist lifestyle she asked me to check it out along first. So I went with friends and liked it so we went a couple of weeks later. She like the pool area although it was a little too crowded. We got food...
The Sunnybabe review is not true. A past employee and his vicius wife wrote the review.
"This was our 2nd visit to Sunny Rest...my wife and I were here last August also and we had a blast both times. There is no better feeling than spending the entire day naked with your spouse, hanging out by the pool/bar and meeting new people."
Just got back from a marvelous week at SR. I will not boor you with ditto's but this is the absolute best non-textile resort we have found in the North East. The camping area is large. It offers an assortment of site types from full hookup to tenting. Day or night a fantastic view is never far away. Great and...
"loved it. this was our 3rd time and clearly the best. the room was not bad, the food was much better, the service was good. the pool was fun, the night club was great and the live music at the pool each day was great.....we met some good people..."
My wife and spent Saturday and Sunday there. We tent camped. Walked the nature trail and hung out in the pool area. She also did the 5k event sunday. It was a lot of fun and met a lot of cool people. Would go again.
What a place! If we lived here we would join in a second. My wife and I always feel safe here. It's clean and well run and the staff is the best! People we meet are very nice and you can make good friends here. We only visit once a year and yet people/staff always recognize us. we love the...
"Wife and I had a little adult time and took it up to Sunny rest, and we had a blast! It was a picture perfect weekend weather wise. The food was outstanding, pool was crystal clear and the drinks were cold and refreshing. Wife and I are even talking about buying a pop up trailer to travel up here instead..."
"I have been to Gunnison Beach, NJ, and several other nude beaches up and down the coast over the years but never to a resort. I arrived at Sunny Rest on Friday. After reading many of the reviews I decided to get there early to make sure I could get a good spot around the pool. The weather was a..."
We walked in on a Sunday night to grab a quick bite before a show. Sign said closed - but they were open? Was concerned when the server said they had a limited menu and only accepted cash because they were remodeling. We ordered three rolls and all three were delicious! On of the best yellowtail-jalapeño rolls ever. Rolls were...
"Ate lunch here last month. Having eaten standard US fare for a week I was yearning for something with vegetables. I had a basic stir fried pork with mixed vegetables and it was delicious hot and plenty of it. Service was fine,and not too expensive."
Marked decline of what was once a decent sushi restaurant. Absolutely clueless service. Terrible sushi of dubious quality. Two bad experiences this summer. We will not give Sunny another chance.
"Ate solo as I was here on business. Little mix up as the, very kind but new, waiter led me to believe each nigiri order was one piece - only to later have twice the food brought to my table (meaning 2 orders of sockeye brings 4 pieces to the table). The whitefish selections lacked a little flavor but the..."
"Best sushi I've had in Wilmington, NC. The rolls were awesome, and there was a good selection on the menu. The atmosphere is cool and relaxing, would be a fun place to go at night or just for lunch. I also had a Tokyo Tea, which was delicious! Will be back for more!"
"This is my go-to place for sushi in Wilmington. The sushi chef always remembers repeat visitors and is very friendly. They have a nice ambience and the Good, Bad, &amp; Ugly is one of my favorites!!"
"A petty unbelievable wait time...waitress was good, but obviously not enough staff rolling the maki. Nothing special enough to have me return, although I did enjoy my food, after I finally got it."
"Took an hour to get my appetizer of soup then another hour to get my sushi, and then they automatically assumed I would like to leave a 17% tip."
"I work close to here and it is my go to for Asian food. I can go to Sunny and get Vietnamese, Thai, or Japanese depending on my mood. The surprising part is that they do them all pretty well. They have dine-in and carry-out and have daily specials as well."
Went here from our beach hotel in Wrightsville beach because we read on their website they were the number one voted restaurant out of 512 in the city of Wilmington.
We went to this place recommended by our hotel staff (Mile North Hotel) and we are so glad we did! It had the best pancakes that I have EVER had!! We had the bananas flaxseed and cinnamon roll pancakes! So yummy! Now the waitress was superb! Her name was Ashley and I would recommend getting her for your waitress if...
Sunny Side Up has such an Amazing breakfast menu. During our short few day stay in Chicago we had breakfast there twice so we could try more dishes. Their hash and stuffed french toast were amazing. My husband loved their eggs benedict. The restaurant was in a great location and is small and quaint. The staff was very friendly and...
"This adorable restaurant is in a three story renovated townhome (so if stairs are an issues, ask for the ground floor seating). There is a coffee shop in the basement that (I believe) provided the specialty beverages. This is a BYOB establishment - no mimosas with your brunch otherwise! The innovative menu has something for everyone. Sausage waffles, crabmeat benedicts,..."
What a delight this place is - a charming dining room serving quality food with super friendly staff. They even let us in early when we got the opening hours wrong. We stop by on every visit to Chicago.
I wanted to try this local breakfast eatery. We had to climb 4 flights of stairs to get to our table. I was OK with that but my father with a heart condition was not. The hostess should have offered the elevator. We were told most menu items could be made for kids ($5) but then everything I wanted to...
Best breakfast in Chicago. Had the stuffed French toast but that's not even the beginning. I found out the building was from 1873 and al Capone used to stay here.
I couldn't decide between French toast or eggs. Then I found the combo plate. Sooooo much food. Could have eaten it all. The food was good and the service was good and all at a good price.
"This has to be, by far, one of the most amazing restaurants ever! If you're in Chicago, it's a must go to spot. There was 8 of us so they gladly made a reservation for us. Service was with a huge smile and the food was there quick, but best of course was how great the food was."
"Sunny Side Up is to be found in an old classic Chicago building. It is close to the Water Tower and Michigan Avenue north, so ideal for breakfast for those staying in hotels in that area. It feels like you are entering someone's home. It also looks like the decor hasn't been changed since the 1960s or 1970s. They serve..."
"What a great find just steps off Michigan Avenue. Yummy breakfast food, great local spot. And housed in a great little building. Love finding little (NON-CHAIN!) gems like this. And we were (pleasantly!) surprised by our bill compared to other spots we had breakfast that week."
"We had an amazing three day stay at Bend, Oregon primarily because of an awesome vacation home at Sunny Acres that we could return to at the end of the day! The Cabin suite that we stayed in was comfy, equipped with a King size Bed and other amenities! Pegi Malnik , the hostess is an enterprising woman ( She..."
"We had an awesome vacation in Bend, Oregon and one of the primary reasons is because you get to return to an awesome vacation home at Sunny Acres to recharge for the next day! It's an ideal spot for someone looking to unwind in Nature's lap! Its nested in a quiet spot, away from the lights and hustle n bustle..."
"Every comfort was provided for and Pegi was enthusiastic in her role as host. Where does she get her energy? She knows Bend well, has notebooks full of brochures for improving your experience. Be sure to tell her if you want a fragrance-free room. She's very accommodating. And wow! What a beautifully presented breakfast of your choice. Pegi goes all..."
"We enjoyed our 2 nights stay at Sunny Acres very much. Beautiful room, garden and delicious breakfast. Pegi likes to make it! The choice is amazing. Pity that we didn't make it to relax in the garden."
"Our three nights at Pegi's B&amp;B was about as good as it could get. Pegi is a charming and gracious hostess, accomodating to every need, a real treat to talk with, and a fantastic cook--her breakfast offerings are good almost beyond description! The rooms are a little on the smallish side, but very well appointed and comfortable. The location just..."
"5 nights in the Cabin room. Best bed ever and awoke to a tremendous breakfast selection. Beautiful home, relaxing yard just outside of Bend but plenty to close to town. Pegi was a friendly, inviting host with a full array of local knowledge and spot on dining reccomendations."
My husband and I stayed at Sunny Acres B&amp;B during a two week tour of Oregon. It was located conveniently to Bend and yet far enough away to be perfectly tranquil. Pegi was a wonderfully warm and gracious host and her breakfasts made us not want to leave! A great place to stay.
"We stayed only for one night, unfortunately I wish it would have been longer. Very comfortable, very welcoming, easy to get to, great location, great beds, wonderful breakfast. Pegi loves what she does and she is made for hosting travelers. I hope to be back sometime in the future! (it was me, my husband our 3,5 year old son and..."
Sunny Acres is a beautiful property just outside of Bend. My husband and I stayed only one night but we wished we could have stayed longer. Pegi is a wonderful host and from the moment you arrive you feel welcomed and pampered. Comfortable room has anything you may need or have forgotten. Gorgeous large garden is available for relaxation and...
Classic diner with simple cuisine.Reasonable prices too.Try the banana bread french toast.The place is small but we had no trouble getting a booth.Service was quick
"We go here when we're looking for real Diner food! And that's exactly what you will get here. Its set up inside like your traditional trolley car diner. With booths and a counter. Friendly wait staff. A typical menu. Delicious food, big portions. Average prices. If you looking to step back in time, with the fifties ambiance this is your..."
We always eat breakfast when we are in the area. Cozy place with solid food. Everyone that works there is super friendly as well
"Had a wonderful...filling breakfast.....and will definitely go back next time I'm in Lincoln,NH. The food was great, the waitstaff very friendly and helpful....I would highly recommend the Lincoln Diner."
"Oh my goodness!!! My husband and I thought a quick lunch at a quaint little diner would be a good idea. The wait staff was incredibly rude. Not sure our server knew how to smile or say more than ""drink?"" and ""here"". Not a smile or even any eye contact. Food was so so. Even though the menu says ""comes..."
"I enjoyed the casual, diner atmosphere. Went on a Sunday morning and immediately found two seats at the bar. The diner is small, so I'm not sure if the wait time varies, but there didn't seem to be more than one party waiting at any time. The food was good but pretty typical breakfast fare. I got the banana bread..."
"We were in Lincoln for the long Columbus day weekend and have been in this area a lot. We typically stay in a timeshare with a kitchen, so breakfast is the one meal that's easy to cook in. However, we went out for breakfast after checking out of our hotel and I was so glad we went here. It is..."
"Well, it doesn't have to be a sunny day or a rainy day to go out for a great breakfast at this diner. We had seen it sitting by the side of the road in Lincoln for years and always wondered if it was any good or some day meriting a breakfast stop. What a nice surprise! We will definitely..."
I LOVE this diner. It is one of my favorite places to have breakfast. Thier fancy scrambled eggs are delicious! If you have a sweet tooth try the banana bread french toast. I also like that they serve turkey sausage too.
"Takes you back in time. Classic diner with worn tables, stools at the counter and sweet, friendly waitresses. The food was simple, homey and plentiful. Perfect place to go with children. We were there for lunch but I got the feeling the breakfast would be phenomenal! Excellent value too, 2 adults and 2 kids ate for around $28 and we..."
"It's worth a visit and the $5 to go into the cave. This is a rare chance to see inside a sea cave without getting wet. The backlighting is so strong, you can get amazing silhouette photos of your companions -- or be a friend and take photos for other visitors while you're there -- they will thank and remember..."
"This is a fun, little adventure. It is just lots of stairs down (and back up!) to be inside a sea cave. Worth it for us b/c we had never seen one before."
"While I understand other comments that this is a very quick stop and the cave at the bottom is only about the size of a room, I still can't find a reason to ever skip it if touring La Jolla. I have been 3 times over a number of years. To me it's unique, and when you couple it with..."
"You might have to drive around a few times before you find parking near the gift shop entrance. The stairs can be wet, so you might step in a puddle or two."
Neat little place to stop by when in the area. I wouldn't drive out of your way just to see it alone. Its pretty cheap to go inside the cave. It's the only one you can actually access without having to get in the water.
"It was almost eerie, making our way along the stairway carved into stone and damp from the sea. Fabulous view when we got to the bottom and could view the ocean through an uncanny opening that looked like Sunny Jim's profiled head. It was great fun and not at all strenuous despite the numerous slippery stairs. There's an interesting gift..."
"We didn't have time to do a Kayak tour to the caves, so we went to Sunny Jim's Cave via The Cave Store to see one of the caves. 1325 Cave Street (off of Prospect Street). It was $5. The stairs are in the store that go down to the cave. Its fun and quick. Hang on to the rails...."
"We rented a kayak from a shop at Avenida de la Playa and set out to sea. We wanted to explore Sunny Jim's Cave from the sea side. The ocean around La Jolla is a beautiful place to kayak. On the way to the cave we passed leopard sharks that were basking in the shallower, warm water. They are usually..."
Fun little hike down 145 steps...to a landing in the bottom of the cave. Only $5.00 for a little trip thru history. Watch your head going down. If you are tall it can be a little bit of a stoop near the bottom.
"I saved the cost of a kayak tour by taking my kids to this cave! With the tunnel dating back to the early 1900s, you get to throw in a touch of history. This place is not for small kids or anyone with health issues - the stairs are many and can be slippery. The little store at the top..."
"This is a good hotel, which location is very comfortable, not far from Ventura and other stores, wonderful view at the ocean and clean seashore. But the key point is the staff. Everybody is very friendly and kind. Employees of the hotel welcome guests, help with any kind of information. Especially, concierge. Williams is very helpful guy! We have such..."
"Throughout my life I have traveled extensively staying at hundreds if not thousands of hotels for business and pleasure. This stay was for business. Many hotels are so standard as to not inspire a review; like going to a different but same-as-the-last McDonalds. But, I don’t believe I have ever stayed at a worse hotel than this one. You can..."
Patty at the shore bar out by the pool was amazing!! So helpful and polite! :-) Definitely go visit her!!! She went out of her way to help us make welcome! Her drinks were amazing as well!!! I would give her two thumbs up for sure!!!!!!!!!!!
I honestly had a good time the worker by the pool I believe his name was Chris was very sweet most of all very attentive he made my kids laugh &amp; made us enjoy our stay. Also the security I believe her name was Jessica was such a sweetheart very good customer service and such a good personality. I would...
"Me and my husband stayed at the hotel for 7 days, the room was fairly clean and the bed was comfortable, we had breakfast at their restaurant and the food was really bad and expensive, do not eat there. The location is good, near a mall, restaurants, coffee shops and a market where you can buy groceries if you want...."
"I've been going to this hotel for many years. I've always loved it for it's friendly, non pretentious qualities +the pool and the beach."
"Please pay attention to every bad review because they are accurate. This place was a top notch hotel in the early 80's. It is now a dirty dated dump. The staff was slow and rude...especially Luis Salazar (the manager). We waited for 3 hours to check in because they were ""cleaning"" the room. If by cleaning they meant leaving pubic..."
"Deposit required, and there is a resort charge. Hallways look like dismal. We couldn't open our door when we arrived. Maintenance came to show us how to get in. The rooms were cold, the floors were ice cold. I had to use the runners on each bed as a throw rug. The balcony wasn't safe. The couple next door could..."
"Gosh where to start. Friendly enough staff, with plenty of knowledge, but the hotel is a dismal dump of a place. Old, out dated. Rooms were dirty, had broken furniture, mould and cockroaches. Hotel is near a busy road and gosh its noisy. If I was the owner of this hotel I'd be embarrassed. Sell to trump if I was..."
"My family reunion! Where were they going to stay? Jane, the Manager of Sunny Cove, was SO helpful and I am SO grateful. She went out of her way to make sure all of my family(They rented 9 out of 13 rooms for the weekend."
"I love the Sunny Cove Motel Apartments. What an awesome experience. Jane the manager went out of her way to make us feel welcome. She took care of all the little worries that go with traveling to a place you've never been. The rooms are updated and clean. Bring your own plates and cups, cause the little kitchenettes will drive..."
"Stayed here 3 nights in room 9, a room for 4 with Kitchenette. The kitchenette provided 1 (one yes!) coffee cup, some plastic plates, some glasses no pots or pans. We had to ask for anything. It was hot in Santa Cruz and had no air-conditioning, the fan was giving to another room so we went to target to buy..."
We stayed four nights at the Sunny Cove Motel. The title of my review encapsulates our experience there. The main wing of the motel has about five units in a row leading from the highway (E. Cliff Dr.) to the pool. We stayed in unit 10 adjacent to the pool.
We stayed at this place on a whim because we didn't want to drive home after having dinner and drinks. It was the cheapest place we could find that didn't look trashy and was pet friendly as we had our two dogs with us. The room was very clean and well kept. Everything is old and the sheets were thin...
This is our favorite little cove to visit. We spend the whole trip on the beach that is literally footsteps away from your room. The rooms are standard but cute. They are all very different and we have stayed in almost all of them to accommodate however many people we were traveling with. It's typical for what you would expect...
"Me and my bf left our motel room, because it was disgusting when we got there. But Jane at Sunny Cove Lodge gave us a nice and cozy room for very less cost!! We will definitely come back here. P.S the beach is walking distance!"
"I recently stayed here for a couple of nights. I found it very comfortable, clean, and in a great location. Within walking distance to the beach, shopping and restaurants. Jane the manager was very sweet and helpful! I will definitely be back."
"I thought I was going to Ocean Echo and not Sunny Cove. I'm from Santa Cruz and I thought that I was going to the motel behind Sunny Cove. I'm glad I made the mistake. Sunny Cove has redone there rooms and with a flat screen TV, a kitchen you can sit in and nice vanity (I want the mirror)..."
"Beautiful hotel, beautiful rooms amazing staff. The weather was really bad when we were there but we discovered their kids club and amazing staff!!!"
"I treated my younger sister to a five night stay after a particularly stressful and challenging year. We arrived at Aqualina exhausted and stressed to be greeted by the warmest welcome. Our bags were whisked away by the housemen and we enjoyed fresh chilled towels and complimentary bellinis while we checked in. We were escorted to our room, shown how..."
"To begin with it was cold for south Florida 60 and windy. However there were no smoothie each hour at the pool. In fact the pool restaurant, the most reasonably priced closed 2 days of our stay without notice. Service was very good except when it involved food. For the price at this hotel I expected excellent food. Room service..."
"Me and my Fiancee came in for breakfast, as we approached the buffet there was a gentleman named Albert standing next to the buffet, who just said hello, he dint even bother to ask us if we are having breakfast or wanted to be sat, waiting few minutes to be sat, we decided to leave cause he just ignored us...."
"Acqualina is like no other resort - truly exceptional. Nothing is too much trouble at this beautiful, top notch resort. The location, décor, rooms, staff, food, spa, and products are several cuts above the rest."
"We spent the week after Christmas at the Acqualina. We had a two room suite and another separate room. The rooms were spacious and well-laid out for a family. The hotel and grounds are beautiful. The building is a Mediterranean fantasy and the grounds are enormous, particularly when compared to neighboring properties. The beach is especially nice. The hotel has..."
"Travelling in a party of 11 from 13 months to 70 years old this hotel managed to accommodate us all. The rooms are pristine, the service is exemplary and the food could not be better."
"I stayed at Acqualina for about 10 nights and I was not impressed. In fact, I was disappointed with the hotel, given the extremely high price of my stay ($1440 per room per night). To start with, my room had a strange smell (maybe a moldy carpet, but not sure), the air conditioner was making a strange noise (vent was..."
We stayed here over the holidays and had a great stay overall. There were a few service hiccups likely due to the hotel being completely full which we've never experienced while staying there. Service on the beach was spotty and there were times when it was painfully slow to get any service and we just gave up. The wifi and...
"When I hit the Observation Deck in Rockefeller Center, I felt as if I were seeing a 3-D movie for the first ten to twenty minutes. And it's not so great for that time being because I'd seen so many New York skylines in the films and TV series. But it's getting more and more tangible; at last, I've felt..."
"Bought advance tickets before we left home, which included pictures. Best thing I did. The family pictures they took were great, and they were just sent to my email. No fusing with the prints to carry around. We went at 7pm and the views were spectacular, and not very crowded. I loved it better than the Empire State Building.....which cost..."
People had said do The Top of the Rock instead of The Empire State Building as the view is better and you also get a view of The Empire State in it. Definitely go with this. The view is one of if not the best in New York. It's more of an attraction than The Empire State and is better...
"Went on a very clear winter night in January 2016. Views are spectacular. Make sure to go to all observation decks, especially the top one."
"This was one of my favourite parts of my NY trip in Dec 15. My husband &amp; I paid a little extra for the VIP package, which gave us 2 souvenir photos to take home."
We went up at about 2pm and stayed for the evening to get a view of the sun setting. I preferred here to the Empire State Building which we done at night because there's better seating and also you can see the Empire State Building in the view. All staff were extremely friendly. The guards on each floor were happy...
"We bought the Sun &amp; Stars package in January to visit the centre. What an experience, 1st day we went up at 10pm to see the night, in hindsight we should have booked the 4pm slot for sunset. The following day we returned to view the sunset which wasn't great as lots of clouds."
"Amazing views, we got a NYC pass so got free entry. They let too many people up though, very crowded, had to queue for 20 mins to get out! Great views though, better than the empire state."
Top of the Rock Observation Deck is a beautiful and serene place. you get the whole view of the city
"This was by far one of our most enjoyable mornings, it was really something we will remember for the rest of our lives. The entrance is easy enough to find and has the huge red carpet on the floor saying Top of the Rock!"
My sister and I were in LA for the weekend and on the hunt for a delicious brunch. TA directed me to this place and as always I was not let down. We were quickly seated even though it was a Sunday afternoon. I got the Hangover plate as it reminded me of a Latin American breakfast. My sister got...
"What a fun place is the Sunny Spot. Be sure to make reservations for brunch on the weekend. My second recommendation is take advantage of the ""Bottomless Bloody Mary, Mimosa, Sunny Side Punch"" deal. You will have to stop the server from refilling - and you can change from Bloody Mary to Mimosa and back ...... and then call Uber..."
"Worst food I've had in ages ! Always looked busy and was local so gave it a try ,terrible ambience ,dirty tables ,inedible food and expensive so won't be going again !"
"Hipster chic decor, I.e. Funky, kitschy and comfortable. Eclectic menu with manyy Caribbean influences from Puerto Rican mufungo to Jamaican jerk...wine list includes a local Topanga Canyon Cabernet which was quite good. Tats, beards and comfort food with a Caribbean spin...eclectic cocktails, craft beers...quiet ambience and dutiful service."
"Great service, superb funky old school vibe. Loved the laid back feel. Superb, fresh, local ingredients. Things taste like someone who cares made the dish. Great cocktails, again - no bar mix, all freshly made juices and mixes."
My husband and I dropped into this restaurant after driving around Venice beach looking for a parking spot on Labor Day. What were we thinking😄. We ended up at sunny spot and had the Cuban sandwich. Wow it was great and I am now in love with the pineapple cider!
"I've been to Sunny Spot twice now. Once for brunch, which was quite the scene and place to be seen. So typical of Venice these days. Went again for dinner/drinks with a group of friends and the night scene was great. Not too crowded and just nice to hang out in the patio area on a summer night. I also..."
"We visited in February and the Caribbean menu looked interesting - it seemed quite a young place and was quite noisy. But we had a lovely waitress and the food was excellent. I had the jerk chicken which had some great flavors, and the cocktails were very good. Looking forward to returning."
My sisters treated me to a birthday lunch at here. We ordered a bunch of apps and a few different entrees.
"We had lunch sitting at the bar. We ordered three appetizers to share. Abundant portions, wonderful food, fun cuisine. The service was excellent. The girl who served us, Candice ( I believe) was great: nice and fun. She made our experience very enjoyable. For dessert we had the coconut creme brûlée' which was very good. The decor of the place..."
I didn't see the other reviews before we came here. Glad I didn't or I may not have visited. Very glad we came. Simply the best breakfast place we've been too in a long time. The portions are huge! People are friendly. Food is fantastic! Love this place. We'll be back!!!!
we went to sunny after seeing an article in online coupon whit we did not use --- upon entering the foyer area the greater welcomed us --- the restaurant seating area was large and open with many tables and booths and as we were the only customers in the place as we arrived during 3pm hour and we had our...
"I had a free coupon from Restaurant.com it was spend $20 get $10 off. I decided I wanted try Sunny Pancake House. As soon as, I entered I was greeted by hostess.She asked did we want table or boot. I decided to get a boot.There was 6 other customers in the dining room area.Then my niece ordered a Kiddie combo($5.29+$1.99).She..."
"Stopped by for a simple meal of pancakes, hash browns and coffee. Only finally received coffee at very end of meal. Hash browns had a very distinctive chemical smell and odor probably from soap or detergent although from the looks of the place both of those would have been hard to find. Pancakes were horrible!!!!! Definitely a major problem with..."
"First seems ok, quickly seated, drinks brought, but then some staff speaks little english, forgot most of food. Waitress never asked if we needed refills. Then never brought check, will not go back."
"I eat at a lot of real good breakfast places all over the north east. Some not so good and some are great. This one fits in the middle, not a bad place but not outstanding. The food is not up to what I would serve. I had an omelette and home fries. The omelette was flat and not fluffy..."
"Had a wonderful breakfast here, the service was great, the food was brought out in a reasonable amount of time, and was delicious. Would definitely recommend as a go to place."
"Loved this little, old-fashioned shore diner. We went there twice for breakfast during our early September stay and were very pleased with the service and the food quality. The menu has a lot of great choices for breakfast-- including eggs benedict. I would go back again!"
"My 4 year old son and I have made it a necessity to go get breakfast at Sunny Hunny every Saturday morning when we're at our shore house @ 3 blocks away. Despite the amount of people walking in, the staff always seems to get everyone seated within minutes of walking. Food comes out within minutes of ordering and the..."
My wife and I enjoyed our breakfast at Sunny Hunny today.
"I could eat there everyday! Food is so delicious, The potatoes are freaking awesome! LOVED the Jersey Benedict with TAYLOR HAM"
We've been coming here for a very long time. Each visit to Seaside includes at least one breakfast here. Always a good breakfast.
It is within walking distance from Starlight Motel and we went for breakfast every day. Great service and food.
Delicious breakfast. I ordered the sunny side up eggs with home fries. I love love love their home fries. The service was excellent &amp; their prices are very reasonable.
"Pancakes are good,but overpriced for 4 small pancakes. Tasty, but small. French toast is very good. Eggs are fresh and cooked properly. Why flake syrup and not real maple syrup? At those prices, it does not make sense. Waitress was s. L. O. W"
My club at there for our Christmas dinner and enjoyed a large variety of appetizers and entrees. Service was great!
"The interior of the building is really nice.The staff was ok, Could have been more attentive, Had to keep hailing him down for more drinks. The food was average nothing spectacular. With so many choices in the area not sure if I would make a special trip there."
the restaurant is a decent sized building to hold parties. the food is very good and tasteful for the palate. many choices can be made when ordering the food and the wait staff is normally helpful in choosing what you would like to eat. the wait time for receiving the food that you ordered can take a little extra time...
"Sunny Palace, Absolutely tasteless,gelatinous mess. Ordered champagne chicken which was just a thick corn starch sauce, no hint or trace of any champagne flavor. Drinks were reasonably priced,extremely sweet and very watered down. Overall very disappointing, do not recommend and will never return"
This restaurant is one of the better authentic Chinese restaurants in East Brunswick. You can tell when you see other Chinese people dining there.
"Stopped by with the family for a Sunday evening dinner. Service was above 5 stars. Food was exactly as ordered and tasted great and fresh. Even though they were busy with several parties, our server made sure to stop by and address any issue or concern we had, and we had absolutely none."
"The restaurant is beautiful... lovely décor. The food &amp; wait staff was good. If you go beyond just pointing to the items in the dimsum cart that you want to eat, you may run into a language problem. Staff is accommodating &amp; you can get your idea across."
"Once you arrive you will notice the large fish tank. To the left a well stocked top shelf bar. Pleasant enough to go and just enjoy a cocktail. The tables have white linen, the wait staff in tuxedos. Classy. I had lunch with a friend during the week day. We ordered a cocktail. Both were prepared to our satisfaction. We..."
Been here for dim sum and have tried take out a couple of times. This place has mediocre authentic and Americanized Chinese food. The dim sum is nice but the service is poor and unfriendly. The dinner menu consists of both authentic and Americanized Chinese food. Other than dim sum the food at this place is mediocre at best and...
Have met friends for lunch here in the past and have been moistly pleased with our food and service. Yesterday did not follow suit. Our server began with an attitude when I asked for lemon for the water. We waited too long and then he brought only 2 wedges for three people. Rushed us to order and then when we...
"Heard through the grapevine about Sunny's, I live about 40 minutes away but shop in the area and thought it would be a good place to try something new. I love Asian food and hadn't tried Korean until Sunny's. Love Sunny, SHE is the owner and the chef, a one woman show, with a single waiter who is the only..."
"Very good food, Decor could use a bit of freshening up. Very good service. Owner came out to greet up - nice touch."
"I highly recommend the bulgogi, either the beef or the chicken! It was delicious! And the staff was very friendly!"
We enjoy Korean food and had to stop in town for the night on s road trip. Looked on your site and found a great rated Sonny's!
Absolutely love Sunny's cooking. Everything is made fresh. So many gluten free options. Bi Bim Bob is my favorite. Sonny (waiter) is so knowledgeable and always remembers our favorite dishes. We have been dining here for 15 years and highly recommend.
"This place doesn't look like much on the outside (or the inside, for that matter), but don't let that fool you -- the food in this place is fresh and delicious! I spent a year in South Korea when I was in the Army and the food in this place is honestly as good (and probably a bit better) than..."
"The food was amazing. I had the Snowey Chicken, it was incredible. My mom had the Spicy Chicken with Egg Plant and she said it was amazing. I will definitely come again."
"My daughters and I went to this restaurant. I must admit the hospitality, cozy atmosphere is top notch. However, for me personally, the food was way to salty. My daughter ordered an item that was served cold. They saw she didn't like it, and immediately replaced it."
"A friend invited me out to lunch to Sunny's, which is a favorite of hers. I can completely see why! The food surprised by how amazing it was! I ordered the chop chae and would gladly get that again and again! I went back within a week and ordered the Bi Bim Bap and loved it! I think I'll have..."
"Upon reading the reviews, I knew a few things and was prepared to a) not have ""atmosphere"" and to have to wait a while, but who doesn't want fresh food?! We were excited to go, and Friday night was a good time to try it out. My husband and I went with a five year old and a sleeping baby..."
"Stayed overnight on our way to Key West. Very nice surprise! Clean room, comfortable bed, plenty of room and a great breakfast. The staff at the front desk were very nice. Easy checkout. I will stay here again in the future. Keep up the good work!"
"Entering the lobby you immediately see the Travelodge awards received by the owners of the property. The reception is quick and friendly and you begin to feel why this Travelodge has been judged so highly by the parent company. The property is older, as most are in the area, but the cleanliness and effort to install quality fixtures, such as..."
"I stayed at many hotels, this one we were pleasantly surprised as it was clean, confortable and friendly staff. Breakfast included in price and you are 1 hour drive from Florida keys. I stayed for 3 nights. For the star rating this one is at the top."
This is a very nice Travel Lodge compared to any other's I've seen. I'm a Wyndham member so I've' looked a lot of them. It is one of the last places to stay at before you hit the Florida Keys. It's about a 2.5 hour drive to Key West from here depending on the traffic.
"We have been there a while a go. We were very pleased with the nice reception. They are very helpful. The location might seem a bit odd, but it was the best place to stay if you want to go and visit the Everglades. We had a great time!"
"We booked last minute trip to explore Miami but all hotels nearby were really expensive so we landed up here and vola!! We hit a jackpot. Such a convenient location about 30mins from Miami.2.5-3 hrs from key west. Ryt on us1, nearby gas stations, drive in food places.most of all lovely breakfast by Vicky!homemade and fresh out of her kitchen...."
"Stayed for one night while visiting Key Largo. The hotel is about a half hour away from there. Mr. P.K. Mehta welcomed us warmly. The room was better than I expected. The beds were clean, comfortable and nicely made. The microwave worked perfectly. The television was top notch. I did not hear any noise from neighbors. Everything in the room..."
We had been by this place a few times and hadn't given it any thoughts to try until our neighbor at the RV park mentioned that we should give it a try. I must say I am so so glad that we did. We have been there twice now (dinner &amp; breakfast). Dinner was good but I must say breakfast...
"We stopped after a doctor's appointment, since we hadn't really eaten breakfast. It's located in a small strip mall and looked like it might be quite busy, given the number of cars outside. But we were seated right away and served quickly. The atmosphere was relaxed and food was really good, with a nice selection. I had a California omelet..."
"The decor is not what you would expect in a restaurant in the desert. But , what a fun place to eat! We stopped in around 2 PM on a Saturday afternoon so we almost had the place to ourselves. Our service was top notch with just the right amount friendliness. We both opted for omelets and were excellent. This..."
"Stopped for breakfast with my wife. We both enjoyed the food, good portions and tasty. The staff was attentive and the atmosphere in nice. Was a very relaxing location to start the day."
"Tasty, tropical themed restaurant close to the airport. Very reasonably priced, good thing too because our hotel buffet was inedible. Excellent California omelet! Very fast service."
"My Daze burrito was good, lots of meat but it was a train wreck. The fries were soggy and the seasoning was inconsistent. My companions Reuben was average but served quickly by the friendly staff. The milkshake was good but not better than most of is would make at home."
"Yummy! When you walk in you will wonder what idiot writes an 5 star review for an outdated tiki shack. Well that would be someone who appreciates an outstanding breakfast and fabulous service( Thanks to Flora). Pancakes that are light and airy, (they do have sugar free syrup) eggs perfectly prepared, hash browns the way you want them and marmalade..."
"You have to figure it the locals like it, it's good. Had breakfast there and the menu is big enough to give lots of choices but not so big as to be overwhelming. What I especially like is the friendly, jovial and attentive service. We weren't sure how many people we'd have so they set if for 6 and said..."
"Followings reviews I read on Trip Advisor, we decided to go for breakfast. The restaurant is clean and decorated in a tropical fashion, surprising us and reminding us of restaurants in Florida. The staff were pleasant and service was good. We both ordered the California omelet and were not disappointed. The food arrived hot, as described in the menu and..."
"Amazing. You can taste the homemade freshness of everything even though the kitchen appears as a typical diner. Homemade soups and chips for dipping are amazing. I had the pork tacos in thin flour tortillas with guac. Wow!! It helped that we were hungry but this place rocks. Goes to show that good food always wins in the end, because..."
Had lunch and breakfast there several times. The place is always packed and for good reason. A wide range of lunch items and specials. It can get a little tight in there with all the customers but that helps add to the atmosphere. Our service has always been quick and the food hot when delivered. Not sure you can go...
Had a great breakfast here today ! Small cafe on Main Street with inside outside seating . Great crepe menu and breakfast platters . Flavored hot and iced coffees . Tables are small and there are a lot of things on them that could go to make room for larger plates. Waitress was a little cold even after we told...
Outdoor bistro seating is unusual for Bel Air and we'd heard how great this place was. Everybody kept telling us you have to go there - so we did and there was a line and we were so excited to finally get this fabulous breakfast. Well truth is the breakfast was OK - both Bagel Works and believe it or...
"They cater our board meetings &amp; we always get a wide variety of pastries &amp; muffins that satisfy so many tastes. Their warm, red velvet muffin is a favorite. What a delicious treat to start your morning business meeting. They deliver to our site, so they do have catering. Always friendly &amp; accommodating our needs.Coffee could be a tad bit..."
"am - Wide selection. All very tasty. We had crepes, pancakes, perfectly cooked eggs, both ""kinds"" of hash browns, breakfast meat."
"There were 4 of us here on Sat around ""brunch"" time. This is a small cute restaurant. We began outside but then moved inside as soon as a table opened as it was getting chilly. I am guessing they can seat 40 or so inside but it is wall to wall! One restroom for both men and women. Two of..."
"In addition to finding a hair in my crab cake sandwich, a crazy man from off the street harassed my two kiddos while we were outside lunching. The hostess wasn't dressed for the seasonal occasion, but she was definitely a wicked witch. It's true what they say, ""you are what you eat"" because I left feeling crabby--remorseful I should have..."
Great place for a lunch with tables outside to enjoy the weather. Good sandwiches and great soup. Wait staff was very friendly and provided fast service.
"Love the Sunny Day on a Saturday morning. Owner comes out to greet you and ask if everything is OK. Staff is friendly and prompt. The breakfast dishes are fantastic. Whatever time of day you get there, try the chicken salad. One of the best i have ever had. Pouring out of the wrap they stuff it so full."
"I loved this place!! It's super cute. We ate outside on a Saturday and a band was playing. Decent prices, large portions! Loved it!"
We stopped for a late lunch and from beginning to end it was a great experience! Menu offers a wide variety of choices and Jarred our waiter went out of his way to help us select our meal.
"There was a approximately 15 min wait to get our seats, but that's all and good for a 1030 Sunday morning. Food was exceptional and reasonable price..staff was excellent as well!"
"I'm always looking for GF breakfast foods. The cakes here were really good! My husbands 4 egg omelet and fresh and very good. They open at 8am, we were there at 8am, by 8:30am the place was packed. So either arrive early or be prepared to wait. It was worth it and the short drive from our downtown Asheville hotel."
Eclectic wait staff and local flair make this a must-eat. Visited Friday night with the hubby. Thoroughly enjoyable!!
"Our wait time was way less than expected but we made up for it by waiting for our ""misplaced"" order for 50 minutes. Our waitress was very apologetic... Huevos rancheros- very salty, although the chorizo was excellent. Maple bacon in the Bloody Mary was very tasty. Worth the extra $1. The chicken and waffle sandwich was very tasty. Sweet and..."
I had the potato wrapped salmon and my husband had the flat iron steak. Both were delicious. I would love to try the breakfast.
"after a milding disappointing visit in October, we tried it again in December and really liked it. Service was first rate. I had sausage-gravy biscuits with eggs and they were great!"
Pretty good food and atmosphere. A nice neighborhood spot for breakfast (I haven't tried the other meals). I've been a few times and will go back.
"The food was as great as they say, but it was winter and we were seated in the area with the ceiling heater and one side of the table was practically sun burned."
"We came here for breakfast one morning and it was good. Its a small place and the wait can be lengthy. I ordered the sweet potato waffles which were good but kind of cold when I got them. My boyfriend ordered the biscuits and gravy but it was quite spicy, which he didn't like. Overall a good experience."
"I had never been kayaking before and was a little nervous about it. I soon realized that thanks to our guide! Kelly, I had nothing to worry about. She gave us a very thorough safety demonstration before we started. It was a beautiful day and we saw lots of wildlife. She was very knowledgable, which made it very interesting. Can't..."
"I had a GREAT trip with Sunny Cove in July 2015 with my guides Tara and Bobby. We saw PORPOISES, SALMON, SEA OTTERS and a BALD EAGLE! The views were AMAZING. I would do another trip with them in a heartbeat."
"Kelly (our guide) was updated with the latest information! Thanks to that, we were able to follow a group of Orcas (including a little one!!) and almost caught up with them! We were less than 200 yards away from the orcas - it was an amazing experience :)"
We went out for a night kayak off of Fox Island. It was a great experience. We had not signed up and decided to go at the last minute. I am so glad we did this as it was a highlight of our whole Alaska adventure! Don't miss this!
"This was great fun! Saw eagles, sea otters, seals, and dolphins! After a great morning on the water, we were offered a wonderful meal. The salmon was perfect! Our guides were great! They were very knowledgeable and fun! J.D. will be remembered! Thanks for helping us in making memories that will last a lifetime!"
"While I don't recall our guides names, they were both excellent! Really watched out for us and took care of the needs of someone else who got sea sick. That impressed me after he had told us, rather sternly, that we had to be prepared to stay out 3-hours."
"Our Tonsina Point Kayak and Hike tour consisted of 5 people and our guide, Jack, who took us out for a great day on the water. He was very knowledgeable about Seward and the wildlife, and was safety conscious at all times. As well as this, he was easy to talk to and a lot of fun. The water was..."
"Matt was our guide at Fox Island. He was EXCELLENT very knowledgable about both the area and kayaking. He made everyone feel comfortable while showing us the wonder waters around Fox Island. When he knew we were excited about the Puffins, he made certain we knew how to find them and gave us plenty of time to enjoy them in..."
Sea kayaking off of Seward is the perfect activity to mix physical activity with seeing the beautiful landscape and incredible wildlife. Our guide was excellent - fun and knowledgable. This was my favorite activity during my weeklong trip to Alaska.
"This is a must when going to Alaska. The town of Seward is beautiful and this kayaking trip was my favorite part. Our guide was very knowledgeable and made it all easy for us, who were first time kayakers. The scenery was just amazing. We even saw several bald eagles, one from pretty up close. I definitely recommend this to..."
"We have been to 2 weddings at Sunny Hill in the past 5 years, one in early May and the other at the end of October (this past weekend). Lovely place especially in the fall. The wedding was done on the hill overlooking the beautiful valley/ mountains. Very rustic feel. The hall where the reception was held has a full..."
I have been going with my son on and off for 16 years. He is a teen now and STILL enjoys Sunny hill. It is a beautiful setting. The grounds are beautiful. There are rooms to suit all needs and wants. All the rooms are immaculate. The Nicholsen family continually reinvests in and improves their property all the time. It...
"Spent a couple of days this week here as the result of winning a gift certificate. My wife and I recently retired and pickrd this week to visit. A motel style room, a little dated but clean and comfy. 3 simple meals a day and all the golf you can play."
We won a stay and play three day all inclusive
"This place was amazing. Plenty for the kids to do, beautiful golf course, wonderful scenery, and best of all gentle on the budget. Everything is clean and the people that work there are very accommodating. We plan on making this a family tradition."
"We won a 2-night golf stay at Sunny Hill and stayed over Labor Day Weekend. Although this is primarily a family resort where many have come for generations, we were able to stay at the Thunderhart golf course where there were mostly adults. The accommodations were basic but the entire resort was exceptionally clean and all activities and meals were..."
"Once again Sunny Hill did not disappoint. Golf, basketball, shuffleboard, volleyball, lawn bowling, fishing, the Viking Obstacle Course and plenty of fun by the pool. This year, there was even some antiquing involved in some of the local surroundings. I've said it before but I'll say it again, Sunny Hill is by far the most relaxing vacation one can take...."
"Only spent a couple nights at sunny hill for the first time but it was long enough to know that this is a unique and amazing place and we will be back next year for a longer stay. The activities are endless and you can do as much or little as you like. Children absolutely loved the fishing, several playgrounds..."
"Great place to relax and unwind with the family, everyone is so friendly and nice to be around. This place is truly a wonderful place to go on a good family vacation with also wonderful golfing experience. The only con is it has a bad gym... Very tiny with not much to offer"
It's a great way to see the park and very good value for money. The carriage driver give a very good history guide and tell you who live where is the surrounding apartment blocks
"Regardless of the time of year, Central Park is a must see when in New York. Take a carriage ride and take in the sights."
"We had a fabulous time in Central Park, the snow was high and everyone was out to play. Children and adults on sledges and people walking. It was difficult to see the usual features as covered in snow. Such a lovely time to visit New York"
It's the third time we visit central park and on each of our visits to this city we were never able to skip this attraction! It's a great experience for all kind of people not just those with kids or teenagers. Do not miss visiting this landmark and enjoying the diverse attractions.
"Spent a lovely afternoon here cycling around the park. it is surprisingly hilly, however, so I recommend NOT hiring the quaint looking bikes with no gears, no brakes and that feel like they've been made from cast iron. Even the lycra clad pros were struggling up some of the hills, so to do a whole circuit, get one of the..."
"Loved this place! My husband &amp; I were there in December, and we took a Horse &amp; Carriage around roughly a quarter of it (from Columbus Circle). Spent pretty much the whole day around there as had visited the Plaza in the morning, then went to Columbus Circle to the German Markets, and then took our Horse &amp; carriage ride...."
"Central park is beautiful all 4 seasons of the year. Great place to walk, exercise, enjoy live music, etc. and get away from the rush of the city. Always hosting amazing events."
"Went for a walk in Central Park a few days after the big snowfall this January - wow, so beautiful! I saw over a dozen blue jays and cardinals, vibrant against the white blanket of snow and the frozen river. I enjoy the quiet hum of Central Park on a weekday morning on a bright winter day much more than..."
As we arrived when the snow was still there it was a magical view to behold. We were offered a horse and carriage ride but I honestly would stick with the walk.
"Do not miss a stroll through Central Park on your next visit to NYC! Lots to see, people watching amazing and a peaceful get away in the midst of it all. Fun attractions for all ages include skating, The Zoo, Tavern on The Green, Strawberry Fields, The Boat pond, The Carousel and lots of playgrounds."
I spent 2 days with a friend and her kids and they had a blast!
Durrant. Jordan. mark. keivin. Man best service I have ever had. I will definitely come back to the definitely come back to the Trump. They made us feel like kings we felt comfortable everything we needed any question we ask they answered
"We stayed at this hotel with 3 toddlers. We were very demanding on our needs. The service was beyond exceptional. The valet was excellent, the housekeeping was excellent, Mariana at the concierge did an excellent job planning out our days! The beach at the hotel is super, is quite wide in comparison to hotels further south in miami beach. The..."
"Do not check in until February 19th called the hotel 2 times asked to speak to a manager both times told no manager was available was told to leave name &amp; # no one ever returned my call I called 1 week apart nothing then went on website left message , nothing your hotel customer service is terrible and be..."
Trump's people are uncompromising in delivering excellent service and making your stay memorable! This was our fourth visit -- we keep coming back for the beach and relaxation -- everyone helps make it the BEST.
"Our family visited the Trump International Beach Resort in Sunny Isles Beach, Florida from January 2-3, 2016. We really wanted to like this place and we quite excited about our stay. My 7 year old son picked with me it when he recognized the Trump name and I thought we'd give it a try as we have never stayed at..."
I traveled here to watch international soccer teams with my mom and a friend. We booked this hotel just two weeks before heading down. When we arrived our room was not ready but we checked our bags and had full access to the resort. After going to the beach for a bit we came back and our room was ready....
"We stayed here as a family prior to heading up to Orlando and Disneyworld. The room was spacious and well-appointed with a large, luxurious bathroom (always something I look for) and a balcony with a stunning view of the beach/ocean. The beds were also very comfortable. Friendly front-desk staff too, which is always a plus. We would return."
"This is an awesome place to stay. The kids club is great for your little ones, I would say under the age of 9 is best. It's on beach, plus has great pool and food, drinks, etc. rooms were awesome. I would go back in a heartbeat."
"This high line is a renovated, elevated rail track which has been beautifully renovated with plants and trees and enables you to walk through the old meat packing district above street level so no traffic. Go in the evening as it has some great views and is very peaceful, romantic. Of and its free"
"Nice view of the Hudson/stroll on a non-windy day. Best to then descend for eats and local shopping and the lit fountain at Chelsea Market, or a tour of the new Whitney. In winter, don't miss ice skating eight penguins at Gansevoory Market."
Took a free walk up some stairs to see NYC from an elevated railway platform that was turned into a park. I had heard that a group had to fight hard against the developers to keep this from being torn down. A must see while you can. Nature and free does not advertise so take the hint. Loved it!
"Everyone flocks to 30 rock, central park, ground zero, wall street.......THIS needs to be at the top of your list of things to do. After a tour of Chelsea Market with lunch, we easily got on the High Line and walked up to the Hudson Stock Yards. Fantastic sights and scenes along the way while NYC is under you feet...."
Not just enjoyable but also important.
Take a stroll and see the city from a different angle. Imagine what it was like when these rails were bustling with industry. Great way to get from midtown to meatpacking.
Any season is a great season to walk the High Line. It is a fascinating and interesting view of the city and the river. Take time to relax on one of the chaise lounges or overlooking a busy NY street. Bring a picnic from a nearby take out spot and relax. Lots of fun shopping if you start in the...
nuce stroll on thr highline on a sunny day is great. you can srtop for launch at rhe chealsy market or just get a snack and eat on the bench
"Rain or shine, find solace, art, nature and great people watching on the tracks of the high line. Don't imagine that it won't be busy, but granted your worst fear is being run over by a toddler-walked dog-- not a taxi. So put on your shades, a smile and amble enjoyably along."
"Get a view of NYC above the crowds. See the new construction above the train yards. This elevated walkway is fun, free, and sometimes crowded. Musicians sometimes play along the way."
My wife and I booked a snorkel trip with Sunny Days and had an absolute wonderful time. We were taken to two different reef locations to snorkel along with about 10 other people. The trip total time was 3 hours (an hour travel time and 2 hours to snorkel; one hour at each reef location). Sunny Days has a very...
"I love to snorkel and used to dive, but this is sooo much fun. Well planned, comfortable, a very memorable trip I want to do again soon! I saw so many tropical fish, Manta Rays, tours and friendly crew. I was never on a fast-cat before and it was great! Dry Tortugas was so interesting with so much history and..."
"Booked the ""double dip"" snokelling excursion. The trip ended up being aborted due to so many jellyfish in the water. After approximately 10 minutes of snorkeling we were rounded up and herded back to the boat. The captain tried several other sites, but no luck finding one without the pesty creatures. I was impressed by the staff, particularly Dave and..."
"We booked a snorkeling trip through their website that would visit two locations in the waters near the island. The boat itself is quite nice and spacious and didn't feel overcrowded at all. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable and made sure that everyone had a nice time. While the reefs that we visited weren't over the top amazing, we..."
"We took this trip a year ago, but my family and I haven't forgotten it! My children still talk about it at least once a week. I can't say enough good things about this tour. Yes, the trip was long and I'll admit that I choked at the price at first, but the trip was worth every dime. The crew..."
"Sunny Days was recommended by our concierge at the Pier House, as I had never snorkeled before. He recommends them for beginner snorkelers, and I fully support his recommendation. The three snorkeling guides were informative without dragging on during their instruction. The boat was spacious, the bathrooms cleanly and easy to use (this was a must for me!), the snorkeling..."
"When another tour boat did not reach its minimum paying guests for the day's trip, we took Sunny Days. I'm glad it worked out that way, as there were only 6 guests (their minimum) for our 9 AM tour to Sand Key and Rock Key. The boat holds about 49 people, but I was glad to have plenty of room..."
We had a wonderful time- the staff was great and really helped us out. We arived late to Key West after driving from Fort Lauderdale (it takes longer than you think!) and missed the dolphin snorkeling cruise we'd booked. The ticket booth staff was super accomodating and put us on the next boat with zero hassle at all. Unfortunately that...
The captain and crew were great. The boat was not overcrowded like so many other catamarans we saw. The boat ride was smooth. Unfortunately my wife got seasick so we spent a little more time on the boat than in the water. The crew took great care of us. The captain sat and talked to us pretty much the whole...
"The Dry Tortugas is beautiful, but I highly recommend you spend the money to fly. The trip over and back with Sunny Days Catamarans on the Fast Cat was nothing short of miserable. The trip was advertised as the ""fastest, most comfortable"" boat ride to the Dry Tortugas, which was why we selected Sunny Days. Based on the cost -..."
"This place is 3 star at the most and there is no question about it. Needs a major overhaul! MAJOR. I believe their intentions are honest, but it's the investment that makes places better."
"The internet is not reliable anywhere in the hotel. We received excuses of the wind, too many guests in the hotel and it only works in the lobby, which it did not."
First off this place is supposed to be a resort but it was far from it the rooms were absolutely disgusting mold everywhere the customer service was even worse believe it or not. Completely ruined our vacation!!
Great location with private beach and pier. Have lunch and drinks at the cabana or on the pier. Clean rooms with ocean views. Friendly staff and helpful staff. Great breakfast buffet and awesome onsite restaurant Kitchen 305. Sit pool side or at the hot tub or reserve
"Don't stay here!! For the price you pay it is not worth it!! The rooms are outdated and filthy. Our tv didn't work, the toilet barely flushed, the carpet was disgusting, cobwebs in the outdated lamps, ect... Super disappointing stay!! Will never go back!"
The hotel is located at very convenient location from everything. We liked the hotel except the cleanness of the hotel. The hotel has direct access to beach. The hotel has heated swimming pool and hot tub.
Had a little mixup that was my fault last night. Anell was able to efficiently fix the booking issue and keep me at my new favorite hotel. The most important part to me is that she genuinely cared. Most of the time people at the front desk of at hotel do a good job. She went above and beyond and...
"Misrepresented on pictures. Their so called traditional rooms were small, dingy and more like motels rather than hotel suites. Poor motel is what this looked like to me. Misrepresented in the pictures they show you. Don't know about these other reviews but my experience was so bad that I got out of there as soon as I can. DO NOT..."
"After reading horrible reviews, I was a little nervous on what to expect. I was, however, pleasantly surprised at this resort. Located right on the beach, it was perfect! Amenities include pool, tiki bar poolside, restaurant and bar, breakfast buffet options, coffee shop and gift shop. Additionally, we had an upgraded ocean front room which was fabulous! Some of the..."
We stayed for 15 days and had a marvelous time. We celebrated Christmas and New Years
I want to first say that I am a very picky traveler and my standards are very high. I chose this hotel based on other reviews and I will try to make mine easy for others out there trying to decide where to stay.
"Stayed at the resort for a long weekend. Did not seem very busy and appeared to be on the north end of things to do. Construction two parcels over was a little annoying but not much you can do about that as a consumer. Grounds we nice, common area inside clean and well kept. Pool area had sand in pool..."
I picked this hotel b/c I thought it would be nice to stay in North Miami away from the crowds of South Beach and my daughter lives in Normandy Isles which is 20mins south. The hotel was very nice and it was very clean. The staff was very friendly and accommodating.
"If you don't mind staying just a little bit out of the way, Sunny Isles Beach is just a little bit north of the tried and true Miami Beach area and offers a luxury experience at a good price. On a recent trip to visit Art Basel (located in Miami and Miami Beach Convention Center) I found the better rate..."
"My wife and I spent 4 nights at the resort and had a great time overall. The staff was A+, the rooms B, clean A, nice views A, noise level B, room set up C (TV was in closet and to use closet it blocks TV). Too large of bathroom and too little bedroom, bad ceiling lighting (there aren't any),..."
"This is a fantastic establishment and I would highly recommend. We stayed in November 2015 and had a wonderful 3 night stay. The check in is smooth and efficient. The rooms (we had a suite) are amazing with great facilities. We had a fully fitted kitchen with hob, oven, dish washer and crockery cutlery provided. Washer/dryer. Two TVs. Large bathroom..."
"Flying in from the west coast, we arrived at the hotel at 1:30 am with 6 bags of luggage. We were surprised to find there was no bellman on duty, only a valet attendant who watched as we struggled with our bags. The hotel itself is showing its age, with pealing wall paper and water damage."
"Stayed here for two nights while travelling. The staff are very helpfull, they allowed me to check in early as my room was all ready which was a nice touch. I had a sea view room which had great views. The room was very clean and comfy. This hotel is great, only negative is the wifi in the room which..."
"The bridge is wonderful, the museum near is very nice for the ones who whant some souvenirs. You can walk, or ride a bike ."
We spent a very pleasant couple of hours admiring the bridge from various angles. We then walked most of the way over the bridge and back again. The bridge is great and well worth a visit. Parking was a slight problem but we found there was free parking in an overflow car park just above the bridge on the south...
One can marvel at the view and the construction all day long. Take a walk with a friend or cycle on it. The waters are beautiful. What more can I say
"Visited with family and friends and hired bikes. Rode from San Francisco over the bridge to Sausalito, it was a highlight of our trip. However, I must warn you, be prepared for hills as there are plenty of them. It's easy to get off your bike and walk though, but don't walk your bike on the bridge, the local riders..."
Ran the bridge in early morning and it was breathtaking. Super windy but was prepared for that and well worth it given the spectacular vista that greets you!
"A must visit and drive over the suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate strait, the one-mile-wide, three-mile-long channel between San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean. The bridge has a major influence on the fog by pushing it up or pours down around it."
"As a tourist, I had a few there would be s toll booth and me with not enough cash. I fond a website that said the toll was $7.50. No toll booth in site on a Sunday and we just sailed on through. The day was clear and the view beautiful."
"It's a bridge. Granted a suspension bridge which is an engineering feat, but it's a bridge. The view from the bridge on a clear day is superb, so don't forget your camera. I walked half way through and back and took plenty of gorgeous pictures of the Bay Area."
"We rented bicycles from the Sports Basement on Old Mason Street. It is very close and they have ample parking for you to leave your car while you take the bike out for the afternoon. I think I paid about $70 for two bicycles for the entire day, which included locks and helmets."
A spectacle ! Nothing in words can describe the experience I had while cycling on the golden gate bridge on a sunny winter day of November.
I been last 5 years in this hotel yearly same room and I liked . This year I hate the mattress as got old . Is noisy and the springs want to get out of the mattress . I can't sleep
"This is touted as a resort. The beach is nice as is the restaurant in the hotel, but the room's furnishings were lackluster and worn out. The bed was comfortable and we slept well. For the cost of this hotel, I would have expected more. Steep daily ""resort fee"" for using the beach, wifi, and the pool. Really!? Stay elsewhere..."
I recently stayed with my family at Sole for the second time and it was just as great as the first time! Sleek and clean exteriors extend from the lobby and into the rooms. The location and views are incredible. The hidden gem though is the in-house restaurant. We grew to know the staff as we dined there several times...
"What a lovely hotel; and the food at FAB is amazing. Caleb was a very accommodating young man, friendly and knowledgeable. The oysters are so good as a starter, and the grouper as an entree. Kristina is a magician making drinks behind the bar. We will definitely be back!"
"I stayed at Sole on the Ocean on Sunny Isles Beach over the weekend. The room was amazing, had a splendid view of the beach and amazing customer service. The best experience was when my weekend was heading for the worst. I lost my car keys on the beach in the sand. I found one of your staff members and..."
"Our visit here was amazing! Very nice workers here like Leonurdo, Manuel, Diego, Grey, Kerry, and jade! We will definitely be coming back! I loved how everyone here was just so nice and respectful and greeted you very nicely! The beach was perfect and the food service was great!"
"Stayed here over the weekend, hotel room and staff were wonderful. Only issue we experienced were the the toilet didn't seem to want to flush, we had to wait in between uses to get it to work. Second was the air didn't seem to circulate to the bedroom even at 50 degrees. But overall won't mind staying again."
"Lovely view, pleasant staff. One plastic (maybe acrylic?) chair to sit in, but great to look at. Nowhere in shower to put anything except the floor, no hook for a towel. Cool design, but would encourage owners/managers to actually sleep there a night. Closets big. Breakfast staff very nice. 601B, maybe other units were better."
"There are many places to walk to nearby. Staff are very friendly and super. Great view to the beach from the restaurants up stairs. The service at the front desk and restaurants was very good. Especially thanks to Pedro, Leila and Kristina for the service. Food was especially delicious. The deserts were amazing and very delicious. We hope to return..."
My wife and I went here for a day visit and enjoyed it. Her being new to the nudist lifestyle she asked me to check it out along first. So I went with friends and liked it so we went a couple of weeks later. She like the pool area although it was a little too crowded. We got food...
The Sunnybabe review is not true. A past employee and his vicius wife wrote the review.
"This was our 2nd visit to Sunny Rest...my wife and I were here last August also and we had a blast both times. There is no better feeling than spending the entire day naked with your spouse, hanging out by the pool/bar and meeting new people."
Just got back from a marvelous week at SR. I will not boor you with ditto's but this is the absolute best non-textile resort we have found in the North East. The camping area is large. It offers an assortment of site types from full hookup to tenting. Day or night a fantastic view is never far away. Great and...
"loved it. this was our 3rd time and clearly the best. the room was not bad, the food was much better, the service was good. the pool was fun, the night club was great and the live music at the pool each day was great.....we met some good people..."
My wife and spent Saturday and Sunday there. We tent camped. Walked the nature trail and hung out in the pool area. She also did the 5k event sunday. It was a lot of fun and met a lot of cool people. Would go again.
What a place! If we lived here we would join in a second. My wife and I always feel safe here. It's clean and well run and the staff is the best! People we meet are very nice and you can make good friends here. We only visit once a year and yet people/staff always recognize us. we love the...
"Wife and I had a little adult time and took it up to Sunny rest, and we had a blast! It was a picture perfect weekend weather wise. The food was outstanding, pool was crystal clear and the drinks were cold and refreshing. Wife and I are even talking about buying a pop up trailer to travel up here instead..."
"I have been to Gunnison Beach, NJ, and several other nude beaches up and down the coast over the years but never to a resort. I arrived at Sunny Rest on Friday. After reading many of the reviews I decided to get there early to make sure I could get a good spot around the pool. The weather was a..."
We walked in on a Sunday night to grab a quick bite before a show. Sign said closed - but they were open? Was concerned when the server said they had a limited menu and only accepted cash because they were remodeling. We ordered three rolls and all three were delicious! On of the best yellowtail-jalapeño rolls ever. Rolls were...
"Ate lunch here last month. Having eaten standard US fare for a week I was yearning for something with vegetables. I had a basic stir fried pork with mixed vegetables and it was delicious hot and plenty of it. Service was fine,and not too expensive."
Marked decline of what was once a decent sushi restaurant. Absolutely clueless service. Terrible sushi of dubious quality. Two bad experiences this summer. We will not give Sunny another chance.
"Ate solo as I was here on business. Little mix up as the, very kind but new, waiter led me to believe each nigiri order was one piece - only to later have twice the food brought to my table (meaning 2 orders of sockeye brings 4 pieces to the table). The whitefish selections lacked a little flavor but the..."
"Best sushi I've had in Wilmington, NC. The rolls were awesome, and there was a good selection on the menu. The atmosphere is cool and relaxing, would be a fun place to go at night or just for lunch. I also had a Tokyo Tea, which was delicious! Will be back for more!"
"This is my go-to place for sushi in Wilmington. The sushi chef always remembers repeat visitors and is very friendly. They have a nice ambience and the Good, Bad, &amp; Ugly is one of my favorites!!"
"A petty unbelievable wait time...waitress was good, but obviously not enough staff rolling the maki. Nothing special enough to have me return, although I did enjoy my food, after I finally got it."
"Took an hour to get my appetizer of soup then another hour to get my sushi, and then they automatically assumed I would like to leave a 17% tip."
"I work close to here and it is my go to for Asian food. I can go to Sunny and get Vietnamese, Thai, or Japanese depending on my mood. The surprising part is that they do them all pretty well. They have dine-in and carry-out and have daily specials as well."
Went here from our beach hotel in Wrightsville beach because we read on their website they were the number one voted restaurant out of 512 in the city of Wilmington.
We went to this place recommended by our hotel staff (Mile North Hotel) and we are so glad we did! It had the best pancakes that I have EVER had!! We had the bananas flaxseed and cinnamon roll pancakes! So yummy! Now the waitress was superb! Her name was Ashley and I would recommend getting her for your waitress if...
Sunny Side Up has such an Amazing breakfast menu. During our short few day stay in Chicago we had breakfast there twice so we could try more dishes. Their hash and stuffed french toast were amazing. My husband loved their eggs benedict. The restaurant was in a great location and is small and quaint. The staff was very friendly and...
"This adorable restaurant is in a three story renovated townhome (so if stairs are an issues, ask for the ground floor seating). There is a coffee shop in the basement that (I believe) provided the specialty beverages. This is a BYOB establishment - no mimosas with your brunch otherwise! The innovative menu has something for everyone. Sausage waffles, crabmeat benedicts,..."
What a delight this place is - a charming dining room serving quality food with super friendly staff. They even let us in early when we got the opening hours wrong. We stop by on every visit to Chicago.
I wanted to try this local breakfast eatery. We had to climb 4 flights of stairs to get to our table. I was OK with that but my father with a heart condition was not. The hostess should have offered the elevator. We were told most menu items could be made for kids ($5) but then everything I wanted to...
Best breakfast in Chicago. Had the stuffed French toast but that's not even the beginning. I found out the building was from 1873 and al Capone used to stay here.
I couldn't decide between French toast or eggs. Then I found the combo plate. Sooooo much food. Could have eaten it all. The food was good and the service was good and all at a good price.
"This has to be, by far, one of the most amazing restaurants ever! If you're in Chicago, it's a must go to spot. There was 8 of us so they gladly made a reservation for us. Service was with a huge smile and the food was there quick, but best of course was how great the food was."
"Sunny Side Up is to be found in an old classic Chicago building. It is close to the Water Tower and Michigan Avenue north, so ideal for breakfast for those staying in hotels in that area. It feels like you are entering someone's home. It also looks like the decor hasn't been changed since the 1960s or 1970s. They serve..."
"What a great find just steps off Michigan Avenue. Yummy breakfast food, great local spot. And housed in a great little building. Love finding little (NON-CHAIN!) gems like this. And we were (pleasantly!) surprised by our bill compared to other spots we had breakfast that week."
"We had an amazing three day stay at Bend, Oregon primarily because of an awesome vacation home at Sunny Acres that we could return to at the end of the day! The Cabin suite that we stayed in was comfy, equipped with a King size Bed and other amenities! Pegi Malnik , the hostess is an enterprising woman ( She..."
"We had an awesome vacation in Bend, Oregon and one of the primary reasons is because you get to return to an awesome vacation home at Sunny Acres to recharge for the next day! It's an ideal spot for someone looking to unwind in Nature's lap! Its nested in a quiet spot, away from the lights and hustle n bustle..."
"Every comfort was provided for and Pegi was enthusiastic in her role as host. Where does she get her energy? She knows Bend well, has notebooks full of brochures for improving your experience. Be sure to tell her if you want a fragrance-free room. She's very accommodating. And wow! What a beautifully presented breakfast of your choice. Pegi goes all..."
"We enjoyed our 2 nights stay at Sunny Acres very much. Beautiful room, garden and delicious breakfast. Pegi likes to make it! The choice is amazing. Pity that we didn't make it to relax in the garden."
"Our three nights at Pegi's B&amp;B was about as good as it could get. Pegi is a charming and gracious hostess, accomodating to every need, a real treat to talk with, and a fantastic cook--her breakfast offerings are good almost beyond description! The rooms are a little on the smallish side, but very well appointed and comfortable. The location just..."
"5 nights in the Cabin room. Best bed ever and awoke to a tremendous breakfast selection. Beautiful home, relaxing yard just outside of Bend but plenty to close to town. Pegi was a friendly, inviting host with a full array of local knowledge and spot on dining reccomendations."
My husband and I stayed at Sunny Acres B&amp;B during a two week tour of Oregon. It was located conveniently to Bend and yet far enough away to be perfectly tranquil. Pegi was a wonderfully warm and gracious host and her breakfasts made us not want to leave! A great place to stay.
"We stayed only for one night, unfortunately I wish it would have been longer. Very comfortable, very welcoming, easy to get to, great location, great beds, wonderful breakfast. Pegi loves what she does and she is made for hosting travelers. I hope to be back sometime in the future! (it was me, my husband our 3,5 year old son and..."
Sunny Acres is a beautiful property just outside of Bend. My husband and I stayed only one night but we wished we could have stayed longer. Pegi is a wonderful host and from the moment you arrive you feel welcomed and pampered. Comfortable room has anything you may need or have forgotten. Gorgeous large garden is available for relaxation and...
Classic diner with simple cuisine.Reasonable prices too.Try the banana bread french toast.The place is small but we had no trouble getting a booth.Service was quick
"We go here when we're looking for real Diner food! And that's exactly what you will get here. Its set up inside like your traditional trolley car diner. With booths and a counter. Friendly wait staff. A typical menu. Delicious food, big portions. Average prices. If you looking to step back in time, with the fifties ambiance this is your..."
We always eat breakfast when we are in the area. Cozy place with solid food. Everyone that works there is super friendly as well
"Had a wonderful...filling breakfast.....and will definitely go back next time I'm in Lincoln,NH. The food was great, the waitstaff very friendly and helpful....I would highly recommend the Lincoln Diner."
"Oh my goodness!!! My husband and I thought a quick lunch at a quaint little diner would be a good idea. The wait staff was incredibly rude. Not sure our server knew how to smile or say more than ""drink?"" and ""here"". Not a smile or even any eye contact. Food was so so. Even though the menu says ""comes..."
"I enjoyed the casual, diner atmosphere. Went on a Sunday morning and immediately found two seats at the bar. The diner is small, so I'm not sure if the wait time varies, but there didn't seem to be more than one party waiting at any time. The food was good but pretty typical breakfast fare. I got the banana bread..."
"We were in Lincoln for the long Columbus day weekend and have been in this area a lot. We typically stay in a timeshare with a kitchen, so breakfast is the one meal that's easy to cook in. However, we went out for breakfast after checking out of our hotel and I was so glad we went here. It is..."
"Well, it doesn't have to be a sunny day or a rainy day to go out for a great breakfast at this diner. We had seen it sitting by the side of the road in Lincoln for years and always wondered if it was any good or some day meriting a breakfast stop. What a nice surprise! We will definitely..."
I LOVE this diner. It is one of my favorite places to have breakfast. Thier fancy scrambled eggs are delicious! If you have a sweet tooth try the banana bread french toast. I also like that they serve turkey sausage too.
"Takes you back in time. Classic diner with worn tables, stools at the counter and sweet, friendly waitresses. The food was simple, homey and plentiful. Perfect place to go with children. We were there for lunch but I got the feeling the breakfast would be phenomenal! Excellent value too, 2 adults and 2 kids ate for around $28 and we..."
"It's worth a visit and the $5 to go into the cave. This is a rare chance to see inside a sea cave without getting wet. The backlighting is so strong, you can get amazing silhouette photos of your companions -- or be a friend and take photos for other visitors while you're there -- they will thank and remember..."
"This is a fun, little adventure. It is just lots of stairs down (and back up!) to be inside a sea cave. Worth it for us b/c we had never seen one before."
"While I understand other comments that this is a very quick stop and the cave at the bottom is only about the size of a room, I still can't find a reason to ever skip it if touring La Jolla. I have been 3 times over a number of years. To me it's unique, and when you couple it with..."
"You might have to drive around a few times before you find parking near the gift shop entrance. The stairs can be wet, so you might step in a puddle or two."
Neat little place to stop by when in the area. I wouldn't drive out of your way just to see it alone. Its pretty cheap to go inside the cave. It's the only one you can actually access without having to get in the water.
"It was almost eerie, making our way along the stairway carved into stone and damp from the sea. Fabulous view when we got to the bottom and could view the ocean through an uncanny opening that looked like Sunny Jim's profiled head. It was great fun and not at all strenuous despite the numerous slippery stairs. There's an interesting gift..."
"We didn't have time to do a Kayak tour to the caves, so we went to Sunny Jim's Cave via The Cave Store to see one of the caves. 1325 Cave Street (off of Prospect Street). It was $5. The stairs are in the store that go down to the cave. Its fun and quick. Hang on to the rails...."
"We rented a kayak from a shop at Avenida de la Playa and set out to sea. We wanted to explore Sunny Jim's Cave from the sea side. The ocean around La Jolla is a beautiful place to kayak. On the way to the cave we passed leopard sharks that were basking in the shallower, warm water. They are usually..."
Fun little hike down 145 steps...to a landing in the bottom of the cave. Only $5.00 for a little trip thru history. Watch your head going down. If you are tall it can be a little bit of a stoop near the bottom.
"I saved the cost of a kayak tour by taking my kids to this cave! With the tunnel dating back to the early 1900s, you get to throw in a touch of history. This place is not for small kids or anyone with health issues - the stairs are many and can be slippery. The little store at the top..."
"This is a good hotel, which location is very comfortable, not far from Ventura and other stores, wonderful view at the ocean and clean seashore. But the key point is the staff. Everybody is very friendly and kind. Employees of the hotel welcome guests, help with any kind of information. Especially, concierge. Williams is very helpful guy! We have such..."
"Throughout my life I have traveled extensively staying at hundreds if not thousands of hotels for business and pleasure. This stay was for business. Many hotels are so standard as to not inspire a review; like going to a different but same-as-the-last McDonalds. But, I don’t believe I have ever stayed at a worse hotel than this one. You can..."
Patty at the shore bar out by the pool was amazing!! So helpful and polite! :-) Definitely go visit her!!! She went out of her way to help us make welcome! Her drinks were amazing as well!!! I would give her two thumbs up for sure!!!!!!!!!!!
I honestly had a good time the worker by the pool I believe his name was Chris was very sweet most of all very attentive he made my kids laugh &amp; made us enjoy our stay. Also the security I believe her name was Jessica was such a sweetheart very good customer service and such a good personality. I would...
"Me and my husband stayed at the hotel for 7 days, the room was fairly clean and the bed was comfortable, we had breakfast at their restaurant and the food was really bad and expensive, do not eat there. The location is good, near a mall, restaurants, coffee shops and a market where you can buy groceries if you want...."
"I've been going to this hotel for many years. I've always loved it for it's friendly, non pretentious qualities +the pool and the beach."
"Please pay attention to every bad review because they are accurate. This place was a top notch hotel in the early 80's. It is now a dirty dated dump. The staff was slow and rude...especially Luis Salazar (the manager). We waited for 3 hours to check in because they were ""cleaning"" the room. If by cleaning they meant leaving pubic..."
"Deposit required, and there is a resort charge. Hallways look like dismal. We couldn't open our door when we arrived. Maintenance came to show us how to get in. The rooms were cold, the floors were ice cold. I had to use the runners on each bed as a throw rug. The balcony wasn't safe. The couple next door could..."
"Gosh where to start. Friendly enough staff, with plenty of knowledge, but the hotel is a dismal dump of a place. Old, out dated. Rooms were dirty, had broken furniture, mould and cockroaches. Hotel is near a busy road and gosh its noisy. If I was the owner of this hotel I'd be embarrassed. Sell to trump if I was..."
"My family reunion! Where were they going to stay? Jane, the Manager of Sunny Cove, was SO helpful and I am SO grateful. She went out of her way to make sure all of my family(They rented 9 out of 13 rooms for the weekend."
"I love the Sunny Cove Motel Apartments. What an awesome experience. Jane the manager went out of her way to make us feel welcome. She took care of all the little worries that go with traveling to a place you've never been. The rooms are updated and clean. Bring your own plates and cups, cause the little kitchenettes will drive..."
"Stayed here 3 nights in room 9, a room for 4 with Kitchenette. The kitchenette provided 1 (one yes!) coffee cup, some plastic plates, some glasses no pots or pans. We had to ask for anything. It was hot in Santa Cruz and had no air-conditioning, the fan was giving to another room so we went to target to buy..."
We stayed four nights at the Sunny Cove Motel. The title of my review encapsulates our experience there. The main wing of the motel has about five units in a row leading from the highway (E. Cliff Dr.) to the pool. We stayed in unit 10 adjacent to the pool.
We stayed at this place on a whim because we didn't want to drive home after having dinner and drinks. It was the cheapest place we could find that didn't look trashy and was pet friendly as we had our two dogs with us. The room was very clean and well kept. Everything is old and the sheets were thin...
This is our favorite little cove to visit. We spend the whole trip on the beach that is literally footsteps away from your room. The rooms are standard but cute. They are all very different and we have stayed in almost all of them to accommodate however many people we were traveling with. It's typical for what you would expect...
"Me and my bf left our motel room, because it was disgusting when we got there. But Jane at Sunny Cove Lodge gave us a nice and cozy room for very less cost!! We will definitely come back here. P.S the beach is walking distance!"
"I recently stayed here for a couple of nights. I found it very comfortable, clean, and in a great location. Within walking distance to the beach, shopping and restaurants. Jane the manager was very sweet and helpful! I will definitely be back."
"I thought I was going to Ocean Echo and not Sunny Cove. I'm from Santa Cruz and I thought that I was going to the motel behind Sunny Cove. I'm glad I made the mistake. Sunny Cove has redone there rooms and with a flat screen TV, a kitchen you can sit in and nice vanity (I want the mirror)..."
"Beautiful hotel, beautiful rooms amazing staff. The weather was really bad when we were there but we discovered their kids club and amazing staff!!!"
"I treated my younger sister to a five night stay after a particularly stressful and challenging year. We arrived at Aqualina exhausted and stressed to be greeted by the warmest welcome. Our bags were whisked away by the housemen and we enjoyed fresh chilled towels and complimentary bellinis while we checked in. We were escorted to our room, shown how..."
"To begin with it was cold for south Florida 60 and windy. However there were no smoothie each hour at the pool. In fact the pool restaurant, the most reasonably priced closed 2 days of our stay without notice. Service was very good except when it involved food. For the price at this hotel I expected excellent food. Room service..."
"Me and my Fiancee came in for breakfast, as we approached the buffet there was a gentleman named Albert standing next to the buffet, who just said hello, he dint even bother to ask us if we are having breakfast or wanted to be sat, waiting few minutes to be sat, we decided to leave cause he just ignored us...."
"Acqualina is like no other resort - truly exceptional. Nothing is too much trouble at this beautiful, top notch resort. The location, décor, rooms, staff, food, spa, and products are several cuts above the rest."
"We spent the week after Christmas at the Acqualina. We had a two room suite and another separate room. The rooms were spacious and well-laid out for a family. The hotel and grounds are beautiful. The building is a Mediterranean fantasy and the grounds are enormous, particularly when compared to neighboring properties. The beach is especially nice. The hotel has..."
"Travelling in a party of 11 from 13 months to 70 years old this hotel managed to accommodate us all. The rooms are pristine, the service is exemplary and the food could not be better."
"I stayed at Acqualina for about 10 nights and I was not impressed. In fact, I was disappointed with the hotel, given the extremely high price of my stay ($1440 per room per night). To start with, my room had a strange smell (maybe a moldy carpet, but not sure), the air conditioner was making a strange noise (vent was..."
We stayed here over the holidays and had a great stay overall. There were a few service hiccups likely due to the hotel being completely full which we've never experienced while staying there. Service on the beach was spotty and there were times when it was painfully slow to get any service and we just gave up. The wifi and...
"When I hit the Observation Deck in Rockefeller Center, I felt as if I were seeing a 3-D movie for the first ten to twenty minutes. And it's not so great for that time being because I'd seen so many New York skylines in the films and TV series. But it's getting more and more tangible; at last, I've felt..."
"Bought advance tickets before we left home, which included pictures. Best thing I did. The family pictures they took were great, and they were just sent to my email. No fusing with the prints to carry around. We went at 7pm and the views were spectacular, and not very crowded. I loved it better than the Empire State Building.....which cost..."
People had said do The Top of the Rock instead of The Empire State Building as the view is better and you also get a view of The Empire State in it. Definitely go with this. The view is one of if not the best in New York. It's more of an attraction than The Empire State and is better...
"Went on a very clear winter night in January 2016. Views are spectacular. Make sure to go to all observation decks, especially the top one."
"This was one of my favourite parts of my NY trip in Dec 15. My husband &amp; I paid a little extra for the VIP package, which gave us 2 souvenir photos to take home."
We went up at about 2pm and stayed for the evening to get a view of the sun setting. I preferred here to the Empire State Building which we done at night because there's better seating and also you can see the Empire State Building in the view. All staff were extremely friendly. The guards on each floor were happy...
"We bought the Sun &amp; Stars package in January to visit the centre. What an experience, 1st day we went up at 10pm to see the night, in hindsight we should have booked the 4pm slot for sunset. The following day we returned to view the sunset which wasn't great as lots of clouds."
"Amazing views, we got a NYC pass so got free entry. They let too many people up though, very crowded, had to queue for 20 mins to get out! Great views though, better than the empire state."
Top of the Rock Observation Deck is a beautiful and serene place. you get the whole view of the city
"This was by far one of our most enjoyable mornings, it was really something we will remember for the rest of our lives. The entrance is easy enough to find and has the huge red carpet on the floor saying Top of the Rock!"
My sister and I were in LA for the weekend and on the hunt for a delicious brunch. TA directed me to this place and as always I was not let down. We were quickly seated even though it was a Sunday afternoon. I got the Hangover plate as it reminded me of a Latin American breakfast. My sister got...
"What a fun place is the Sunny Spot. Be sure to make reservations for brunch on the weekend. My second recommendation is take advantage of the ""Bottomless Bloody Mary, Mimosa, Sunny Side Punch"" deal. You will have to stop the server from refilling - and you can change from Bloody Mary to Mimosa and back ...... and then call Uber..."
"Worst food I've had in ages ! Always looked busy and was local so gave it a try ,terrible ambience ,dirty tables ,inedible food and expensive so won't be going again !"
"Hipster chic decor, I.e. Funky, kitschy and comfortable. Eclectic menu with manyy Caribbean influences from Puerto Rican mufungo to Jamaican jerk...wine list includes a local Topanga Canyon Cabernet which was quite good. Tats, beards and comfort food with a Caribbean spin...eclectic cocktails, craft beers...quiet ambience and dutiful service."
"Great service, superb funky old school vibe. Loved the laid back feel. Superb, fresh, local ingredients. Things taste like someone who cares made the dish. Great cocktails, again - no bar mix, all freshly made juices and mixes."
My husband and I dropped into this restaurant after driving around Venice beach looking for a parking spot on Labor Day. What were we thinking😄. We ended up at sunny spot and had the Cuban sandwich. Wow it was great and I am now in love with the pineapple cider!
"I've been to Sunny Spot twice now. Once for brunch, which was quite the scene and place to be seen. So typical of Venice these days. Went again for dinner/drinks with a group of friends and the night scene was great. Not too crowded and just nice to hang out in the patio area on a summer night. I also..."
"We visited in February and the Caribbean menu looked interesting - it seemed quite a young place and was quite noisy. But we had a lovely waitress and the food was excellent. I had the jerk chicken which had some great flavors, and the cocktails were very good. Looking forward to returning."
My sisters treated me to a birthday lunch at here. We ordered a bunch of apps and a few different entrees.
"We had lunch sitting at the bar. We ordered three appetizers to share. Abundant portions, wonderful food, fun cuisine. The service was excellent. The girl who served us, Candice ( I believe) was great: nice and fun. She made our experience very enjoyable. For dessert we had the coconut creme brûlée' which was very good. The decor of the place..."
I didn't see the other reviews before we came here. Glad I didn't or I may not have visited. Very glad we came. Simply the best breakfast place we've been too in a long time. The portions are huge! People are friendly. Food is fantastic! Love this place. We'll be back!!!!
we went to sunny after seeing an article in online coupon whit we did not use --- upon entering the foyer area the greater welcomed us --- the restaurant seating area was large and open with many tables and booths and as we were the only customers in the place as we arrived during 3pm hour and we had our...
"I had a free coupon from Restaurant.com it was spend $20 get $10 off. I decided I wanted try Sunny Pancake House. As soon as, I entered I was greeted by hostess.She asked did we want table or boot. I decided to get a boot.There was 6 other customers in the dining room area.Then my niece ordered a Kiddie combo($5.29+$1.99).She..."
"Stopped by for a simple meal of pancakes, hash browns and coffee. Only finally received coffee at very end of meal. Hash browns had a very distinctive chemical smell and odor probably from soap or detergent although from the looks of the place both of those would have been hard to find. Pancakes were horrible!!!!! Definitely a major problem with..."
"First seems ok, quickly seated, drinks brought, but then some staff speaks little english, forgot most of food. Waitress never asked if we needed refills. Then never brought check, will not go back."
"I eat at a lot of real good breakfast places all over the north east. Some not so good and some are great. This one fits in the middle, not a bad place but not outstanding. The food is not up to what I would serve. I had an omelette and home fries. The omelette was flat and not fluffy..."
"Had a wonderful breakfast here, the service was great, the food was brought out in a reasonable amount of time, and was delicious. Would definitely recommend as a go to place."
"Loved this little, old-fashioned shore diner. We went there twice for breakfast during our early September stay and were very pleased with the service and the food quality. The menu has a lot of great choices for breakfast-- including eggs benedict. I would go back again!"
"My 4 year old son and I have made it a necessity to go get breakfast at Sunny Hunny every Saturday morning when we're at our shore house @ 3 blocks away. Despite the amount of people walking in, the staff always seems to get everyone seated within minutes of walking. Food comes out within minutes of ordering and the..."
My wife and I enjoyed our breakfast at Sunny Hunny today.
"I could eat there everyday! Food is so delicious, The potatoes are freaking awesome! LOVED the Jersey Benedict with TAYLOR HAM"
We've been coming here for a very long time. Each visit to Seaside includes at least one breakfast here. Always a good breakfast.
It is within walking distance from Starlight Motel and we went for breakfast every day. Great service and food.
Delicious breakfast. I ordered the sunny side up eggs with home fries. I love love love their home fries. The service was excellent &amp; their prices are very reasonable.
"Pancakes are good,but overpriced for 4 small pancakes. Tasty, but small. French toast is very good. Eggs are fresh and cooked properly. Why flake syrup and not real maple syrup? At those prices, it does not make sense. Waitress was s. L. O. W"
My club at there for our Christmas dinner and enjoyed a large variety of appetizers and entrees. Service was great!
"The interior of the building is really nice.The staff was ok, Could have been more attentive, Had to keep hailing him down for more drinks. The food was average nothing spectacular. With so many choices in the area not sure if I would make a special trip there."
the restaurant is a decent sized building to hold parties. the food is very good and tasteful for the palate. many choices can be made when ordering the food and the wait staff is normally helpful in choosing what you would like to eat. the wait time for receiving the food that you ordered can take a little extra time...
"Sunny Palace, Absolutely tasteless,gelatinous mess. Ordered champagne chicken which was just a thick corn starch sauce, no hint or trace of any champagne flavor. Drinks were reasonably priced,extremely sweet and very watered down. Overall very disappointing, do not recommend and will never return"
This restaurant is one of the better authentic Chinese restaurants in East Brunswick. You can tell when you see other Chinese people dining there.
"Stopped by with the family for a Sunday evening dinner. Service was above 5 stars. Food was exactly as ordered and tasted great and fresh. Even though they were busy with several parties, our server made sure to stop by and address any issue or concern we had, and we had absolutely none."
"The restaurant is beautiful... lovely décor. The food &amp; wait staff was good. If you go beyond just pointing to the items in the dimsum cart that you want to eat, you may run into a language problem. Staff is accommodating &amp; you can get your idea across."
"Once you arrive you will notice the large fish tank. To the left a well stocked top shelf bar. Pleasant enough to go and just enjoy a cocktail. The tables have white linen, the wait staff in tuxedos. Classy. I had lunch with a friend during the week day. We ordered a cocktail. Both were prepared to our satisfaction. We..."
Been here for dim sum and have tried take out a couple of times. This place has mediocre authentic and Americanized Chinese food. The dim sum is nice but the service is poor and unfriendly. The dinner menu consists of both authentic and Americanized Chinese food. Other than dim sum the food at this place is mediocre at best and...
Have met friends for lunch here in the past and have been moistly pleased with our food and service. Yesterday did not follow suit. Our server began with an attitude when I asked for lemon for the water. We waited too long and then he brought only 2 wedges for three people. Rushed us to order and then when we...
"Heard through the grapevine about Sunny's, I live about 40 minutes away but shop in the area and thought it would be a good place to try something new. I love Asian food and hadn't tried Korean until Sunny's. Love Sunny, SHE is the owner and the chef, a one woman show, with a single waiter who is the only..."
"Very good food, Decor could use a bit of freshening up. Very good service. Owner came out to greet up - nice touch."
"I highly recommend the bulgogi, either the beef or the chicken! It was delicious! And the staff was very friendly!"
We enjoy Korean food and had to stop in town for the night on s road trip. Looked on your site and found a great rated Sonny's!
Absolutely love Sunny's cooking. Everything is made fresh. So many gluten free options. Bi Bim Bob is my favorite. Sonny (waiter) is so knowledgeable and always remembers our favorite dishes. We have been dining here for 15 years and highly recommend.
"This place doesn't look like much on the outside (or the inside, for that matter), but don't let that fool you -- the food in this place is fresh and delicious! I spent a year in South Korea when I was in the Army and the food in this place is honestly as good (and probably a bit better) than..."
"The food was amazing. I had the Snowey Chicken, it was incredible. My mom had the Spicy Chicken with Egg Plant and she said it was amazing. I will definitely come again."
"My daughters and I went to this restaurant. I must admit the hospitality, cozy atmosphere is top notch. However, for me personally, the food was way to salty. My daughter ordered an item that was served cold. They saw she didn't like it, and immediately replaced it."
"A friend invited me out to lunch to Sunny's, which is a favorite of hers. I can completely see why! The food surprised by how amazing it was! I ordered the chop chae and would gladly get that again and again! I went back within a week and ordered the Bi Bim Bap and loved it! I think I'll have..."
"Upon reading the reviews, I knew a few things and was prepared to a) not have ""atmosphere"" and to have to wait a while, but who doesn't want fresh food?! We were excited to go, and Friday night was a good time to try it out. My husband and I went with a five year old and a sleeping baby..."
"Stayed overnight on our way to Key West. Very nice surprise! Clean room, comfortable bed, plenty of room and a great breakfast. The staff at the front desk were very nice. Easy checkout. I will stay here again in the future. Keep up the good work!"
"Entering the lobby you immediately see the Travelodge awards received by the owners of the property. The reception is quick and friendly and you begin to feel why this Travelodge has been judged so highly by the parent company. The property is older, as most are in the area, but the cleanliness and effort to install quality fixtures, such as..."
"I stayed at many hotels, this one we were pleasantly surprised as it was clean, confortable and friendly staff. Breakfast included in price and you are 1 hour drive from Florida keys. I stayed for 3 nights. For the star rating this one is at the top."
This is a very nice Travel Lodge compared to any other's I've seen. I'm a Wyndham member so I've' looked a lot of them. It is one of the last places to stay at before you hit the Florida Keys. It's about a 2.5 hour drive to Key West from here depending on the traffic.
"We have been there a while a go. We were very pleased with the nice reception. They are very helpful. The location might seem a bit odd, but it was the best place to stay if you want to go and visit the Everglades. We had a great time!"
"We booked last minute trip to explore Miami but all hotels nearby were really expensive so we landed up here and vola!! We hit a jackpot. Such a convenient location about 30mins from Miami.2.5-3 hrs from key west. Ryt on us1, nearby gas stations, drive in food places.most of all lovely breakfast by Vicky!homemade and fresh out of her kitchen...."
"Stayed for one night while visiting Key Largo. The hotel is about a half hour away from there. Mr. P.K. Mehta welcomed us warmly. The room was better than I expected. The beds were clean, comfortable and nicely made. The microwave worked perfectly. The television was top notch. I did not hear any noise from neighbors. Everything in the room..."
We had been by this place a few times and hadn't given it any thoughts to try until our neighbor at the RV park mentioned that we should give it a try. I must say I am so so glad that we did. We have been there twice now (dinner &amp; breakfast). Dinner was good but I must say breakfast...
"We stopped after a doctor's appointment, since we hadn't really eaten breakfast. It's located in a small strip mall and looked like it might be quite busy, given the number of cars outside. But we were seated right away and served quickly. The atmosphere was relaxed and food was really good, with a nice selection. I had a California omelet..."
"The decor is not what you would expect in a restaurant in the desert. But , what a fun place to eat! We stopped in around 2 PM on a Saturday afternoon so we almost had the place to ourselves. Our service was top notch with just the right amount friendliness. We both opted for omelets and were excellent. This..."
"Stopped for breakfast with my wife. We both enjoyed the food, good portions and tasty. The staff was attentive and the atmosphere in nice. Was a very relaxing location to start the day."
"Tasty, tropical themed restaurant close to the airport. Very reasonably priced, good thing too because our hotel buffet was inedible. Excellent California omelet! Very fast service."
"My Daze burrito was good, lots of meat but it was a train wreck. The fries were soggy and the seasoning was inconsistent. My companions Reuben was average but served quickly by the friendly staff. The milkshake was good but not better than most of is would make at home."
"Yummy! When you walk in you will wonder what idiot writes an 5 star review for an outdated tiki shack. Well that would be someone who appreciates an outstanding breakfast and fabulous service( Thanks to Flora). Pancakes that are light and airy, (they do have sugar free syrup) eggs perfectly prepared, hash browns the way you want them and marmalade..."
"You have to figure it the locals like it, it's good. Had breakfast there and the menu is big enough to give lots of choices but not so big as to be overwhelming. What I especially like is the friendly, jovial and attentive service. We weren't sure how many people we'd have so they set if for 6 and said..."
"Followings reviews I read on Trip Advisor, we decided to go for breakfast. The restaurant is clean and decorated in a tropical fashion, surprising us and reminding us of restaurants in Florida. The staff were pleasant and service was good. We both ordered the California omelet and were not disappointed. The food arrived hot, as described in the menu and..."
"Amazing. You can taste the homemade freshness of everything even though the kitchen appears as a typical diner. Homemade soups and chips for dipping are amazing. I had the pork tacos in thin flour tortillas with guac. Wow!! It helped that we were hungry but this place rocks. Goes to show that good food always wins in the end, because..."
Had lunch and breakfast there several times. The place is always packed and for good reason. A wide range of lunch items and specials. It can get a little tight in there with all the customers but that helps add to the atmosphere. Our service has always been quick and the food hot when delivered. Not sure you can go...
Had a great breakfast here today ! Small cafe on Main Street with inside outside seating . Great crepe menu and breakfast platters . Flavored hot and iced coffees . Tables are small and there are a lot of things on them that could go to make room for larger plates. Waitress was a little cold even after we told...
Outdoor bistro seating is unusual for Bel Air and we'd heard how great this place was. Everybody kept telling us you have to go there - so we did and there was a line and we were so excited to finally get this fabulous breakfast. Well truth is the breakfast was OK - both Bagel Works and believe it or...
"They cater our board meetings &amp; we always get a wide variety of pastries &amp; muffins that satisfy so many tastes. Their warm, red velvet muffin is a favorite. What a delicious treat to start your morning business meeting. They deliver to our site, so they do have catering. Always friendly &amp; accommodating our needs.Coffee could be a tad bit..."
"am - Wide selection. All very tasty. We had crepes, pancakes, perfectly cooked eggs, both ""kinds"" of hash browns, breakfast meat."
"There were 4 of us here on Sat around ""brunch"" time. This is a small cute restaurant. We began outside but then moved inside as soon as a table opened as it was getting chilly. I am guessing they can seat 40 or so inside but it is wall to wall! One restroom for both men and women. Two of..."
"In addition to finding a hair in my crab cake sandwich, a crazy man from off the street harassed my two kiddos while we were outside lunching. The hostess wasn't dressed for the seasonal occasion, but she was definitely a wicked witch. It's true what they say, ""you are what you eat"" because I left feeling crabby--remorseful I should have..."
Great place for a lunch with tables outside to enjoy the weather. Good sandwiches and great soup. Wait staff was very friendly and provided fast service.
"Love the Sunny Day on a Saturday morning. Owner comes out to greet you and ask if everything is OK. Staff is friendly and prompt. The breakfast dishes are fantastic. Whatever time of day you get there, try the chicken salad. One of the best i have ever had. Pouring out of the wrap they stuff it so full."
"I loved this place!! It's super cute. We ate outside on a Saturday and a band was playing. Decent prices, large portions! Loved it!"
We stayed Jan 15-18 at this hotel. Upon checking in we went to our room and notice it was on the 2nd floor. We went back asked if we could be moved to a higher room as my wife and I just enjoy viewing the ocean. The kind staff not only moved us but upgraded our room to this magnificent...
We had a great time. It was cold outside as expected but the room was warm and cozy. It was clean and the staff was super nice. I will be planning another Winter vacation and we will surely stay here again.
"My friends and I spent New Years in Myrtle Beach and stayed here for my second visit. We had a Jr. Suite with an angle view of the ocean. Spacious, clean, and great views just like when I had stayed here before. The staff at the desk and housekeeping staff are so friendly and helpful. Parking was much more accessible..."
"Extremely clean, friendly and helpful staff, no complaints at all. Nice indoor heated pools that the kids loved. The text communication with the front desk was fantastic. Great location. We really enjoyed our stay here. Will definitely be back."
"I loved this place! It fit our needs to the tee. Our room had two beds in the first area, followed by a bathroom/kitchen and lastly, a separate sitting room with a couch and a pull down bed. I had my daughter, son in law and granddaughter stay in the bedroom area to give them privacy, and I stayed on..."
Decent price and good view. Balcony was nice to have and we enjoyed her indoor pool and hot tub. Felt clean. Staff was very friendly. Room was nice. Wish hot tub hours were extended for adults. We really enjoyed our stay. No complaints.
"We loved our room! Amazing view. The indoor and outdoor pools were awesome also. Very nice. We loved the private balcony and beds were very comfy. I also liked the fact it had a laundry room, as a mom that was a help."
"First and foremost, staff is very very friendly. The room was spacious and had two queen beds and a great view of the ocean. Nice efficient small kitchen, supplies in desperate need of updating. Bathroom show head terrible needed replacing. Towels were like sandpaper, but plentiful in room. We went to pools everyday over our four day stay, towels at..."
"Want to state upfront that the staff was friendly and very courteous. The resort itself, was outdated, hasn't been upgraded except for our bathroom. We stayed in 629 on 1/2/16 and will leave on 1/4/16. If the cancellation fee hadn't been so high, we would have left after arrival."
"Great day trip. Went on a rainy day. Much of it was under cover. Brought a rain poncho, worked well. Went through the whole place in about 2-3 hours. Fun!"
The Dolphin and the Sea Lion shows were simply great! My wife and my daughter also joined the Dolphin Encounter and they loved it!
We decided to try this out since it was a dry place to visit and we had a plane to catch. What a great place!! The shows were great and the people who work with the animals were so friendly! I also liked how they included the visitors. Most places like this are all about you just watching the animals....
"Everyone was super friendly and helpful. I was shocked at how pleasant and happy the staff and crew were, truly a family operated business."
I had driven past Theater of the Sea numerous times and finally decided to see what it was all about. What a nice surprise. The same family has owned the place for over 70 years. Originally it was one of Henry Flagler's quarries for stone to build the railroad. It was flooded and used as holding tanks for bottle nosed...
The beauty of this place is that they care for animals that would not survive if released.
It was kind of like an old school sea world. It was a cool place and the dolphin show was really fun. there were lots of fish and birds to see. Definitely a fun thing to do one morning or on a cloudy day. It's all outdoors so there's no a/c
We visited with our young son and he loved the dolphin and Sea Lion show so much he cried when we had to leave! Highly recommended!
"Went to this ""little sea world"" just looking for something to do with my last day in the Keys. But was very pleasantly surprised. The cast is very knowledgeable and passionate about what they are doing and the ""shows"" are entertaining and informative about conservation without being preachy. A good way to spend the day."
"When you love your job it shows and makes for a great ""theater"" experience. Truly enjoyed our visit here."
"We got to come to seaworld with our package from Discovery Cove. We really enjoyed the shows and had a lot od laughs. We came on a Saturday so it did get a little crowded but that was as to be expected. I loved that throughout the day you can get your pictures taken at different spots in the park,..."
"I went with my family in 2006. Then I went in 2009. Then I went in 2011. Then I went in 2013. Then I went in 2015. We go here a lot because of the many amazing rides and fun experiences that we've had. Shamu got water all over us, the rides were fun, and I'll never forget the time..."
We visited mainly for the penguins 🐧.
"I recommend to all families with young or old kids great for grandparents too.All the animals look well taken care of, the park was very clean and the food and snacks were great."
"The shows were amazing, well worth a visit. It was a very cold day but still lots of things to occupy us, would like to return on a warmer day..."
"It's tough to give this attraction 5 stars after having spent a day at Discovery cove first. Sea world is still a great place to spend a day and there are great shows to watch and the aquarium is really well done. The rides are good, not great."
We visited SeaWorld as part of an organized activity with a youth group we attend. It wa an extremely cold day in January.
"Had a great day at SeaWorld, enjoyed the shows. The park was very clean with a lot of food options. Enjoyed the rides and cant wait to come back."
My 8 year old son enjoyed all day and every attraction at this park.
excellent shows please check the times and dates.skating ice live animals show fireworks and well lit up.
"I mean you get to go down in the cave and look at all these ridiculous creatures! It's amazing. I've done this as a kid, and now twice as an adult, and will do it every chance I get when I visit Oregon! Birders will enjoy the close looks at Western Gulls, cormorants, and sparrows in the above ground section!"
The sea lion caves are truly unique and interesting to watch . Prices are a little spendy but you gotta do it at least once in your life! So take the kids for a fun adventure and enjoy the experience!
"I definitely would not miss this attraction. Yes, it's some climbing and a long elevator ride, however once there in the cave, the minute the first sea lion comes into view you'll forget how you got there. The seal's were having the most fun. Some catching waves just as they entered the cave, while others stayed in little ""cubby holes""..."
A lot of people complain this place is an overpriced tourist trap. I guess for them the idea of shelling out $14 to go see a big cave and some animals in their natural habitat is a bit too steep to stomach.
"Been here several times with my kids and visiting friends/family. It's an elevator ride 200 feet down into the caves where the sea lions live and sleep. If it's a sunny day you can find them out on the rocks sunbathing. It's a bit smelly,but the cave is interesting. There is also a gift shop for souveniers."
"The cave was so dark it was so hard to see the sea lions. It was smelly (which added to the authenticity). :o) We love wildlife, so this was a must see for our family. Just wished it wasn't so expensive to ride the elevator down. We spent a couple hours here, however. The gift shop could use an update!"
"My daughter and her husband along with my granddaughter and myself visited the Sea Lion Caves it was interesting the cave had only a couple sea lions, the majority were outside near the south walkway. I recommend binoculars or a camera with zoom as it was hard to see otherwise. It's a great travel destination if you like sea lions...."
"But we loved it. We are definitely off the beaten path type of travellers, but LOVE sea life so we thought what the heck. Definitely worth it. The smell wasn't that bad, ya go nose blind pretty quick, the noise wasn't deafening, actually kind of soothing and musical at points. The trip back up is steep but doable. Pricey at..."
"Definitely a tourist spot, but actually I don't mind them capitalizing on it! The fee is pricey, but you don't actually have to pay if you would just like to hike down a path you can view the sea lions on the beach for free, although you can't get that close. If you make the trip there, I'd suggest spending..."
I am so glad I did this. We went at high tide. The cave was quite full. The roaring to each other cant be described. It is dark so give your phone time to adjust to the lighting before shooting the picture. My videos turned out the best. It is cool to see these creatures in their natural habitat!
"After reading reviews we decided that this was a can't miss place for dining. The apps we ordered were disappointing...crab dip, She Crab soup and Clam Chowder. All were very unexciting. We all were expecting to be wowed. The hush puppies were great. Our server brought us the wrong bottle of wine and was very tacky in saying it was..."
"We come to this area several times a year and we always eat at the Sea Captain House. The food and atmosphere are great. We enjoy our breakfast experience, the gentleman cooking eggs at buffet makes you feel special, also knows his stuff. Would definitely recommend."
We went on a weekend so make sure to make reservations. I chose the chefs special and it was delicious. Also I tried the shrimp from someone else's plate. It was good also. Wait staff was friendly and efficient. It is a good place to visit while in Myrtle Beach.
I used to eat here in 70s...took my grandchildren.....great lunch prices and food was great....decor beautiful and restaurant is right on the beach! Dessert was awesome ( get the chocolate!!!!!!😍) highly recommended!
Wonderful place for seafood! We have eaten dinner here several time when we visit Myrtle Beach. Nice views and great food. Hush puppies are delicious. We would definitely recommend this restaurant.
"this is one of the best restaurants in Myrtle Beach. I got the Captain's Muddle. It was a a mixture of sea scallops, mussels, clams, some white kind of fish, shrimp, cubed potatoes and celery in a tomato saffron broth, Absolutely amazing. My hisband got the broiled seafood platter. He loved it."
"Always Great Food !!!! There Breakfast Buffett sooooooo Goodddddd!!!!!!!!! They also make fresh omlets, they have a station just for that at buffet. Also there coffee is always exellent!!!! Always very clean, Very Nice Staff!!! You can't beat the price either, Buffet $10.00 all you can eat. I'm a local , I've been going for years........ Great Going, Sea Captian's..."
"Just ate dinner at the Sea Captain`s House. My wife and I split an appetizer, seafood salad, , and the broiled seafood platter. Everything was great, and had no problem with ordering everything from their gluten free menu which my wife needs. It is the last day of January, so we had no problem getting right in. Views were spectacular...."
"We eat breakfast there everyday as it is part of the golf package we book. Their omelette bar is excellent and has many choices to fill those omelets with. They also have a breakfast bar to get cereal,bacon,scrambled eggs etc if you are in a hurry. You can also order off the menu if you so choose. Try the eggs..."
"My husband and I came to this restaurant twice recently and it was great both times. Local seafood, friendly servers and greeters, and great shrimp and grits. The view is nice as well!"
"Generally the staff was polite, and pretty laid-back as it was off season. The reception is in a building across from the street, and they do give military discounts.The room was clean. Housekeeping just came along in the afternoon to just exchange our wet towels for clean, fresh ones. The old reverse cycle AC was quite loud at night and..."
"Three day off season price was really great--very hard to beat. Hotel is old, but fine. Called 4 times for extra pillows. Alex and Jordan(?), I know you said you haven't forgotten about me, but been out of there about 2 weeks now, and never got those pillows! Probably should just mail 'em to me now. ;) Indoor hot tub..."
"Three of us stayed Jan. 1 &amp; 2, 2016 in an 'Ocean Side Family Suite' - 2 rooms with 1 Bath in the Dunes Building. One room was a bedroom with two double beds. The other room was a living room/kitchenette combination with a pull-down double wall bed. This room was located on the Ocean Side of the street with..."
Wouldn't stay here again this hotel needs to be updated. We called front desk to let them know we needed towels and washcloth didn't receive until the next morning we had to go to Walmart to buy our on. Then we had a room with the kitchenette didn't have no pots to cook in had to go buy that.This hotel...
"We were placed in a first floor room on the beach side. The room was very dirty!!! Lots of built up dirt on the floor, in the bathrooms and furniture. OK, I can deal with that, the part that was disapointing was the constant knocking on the door from other guest trying to get into our room. Seems these were..."
"I booked a last minute trip on Dec 24 for a stay from Dec 25-28 2015.I read the most recent reviews for the Sea Mist Resort after I had already booked our reservation. I was nervous after reading reviews about bedbugs. So before we left to go to the hotel, I looked at videos and read articles on how to..."
"My husband and I asked for early check-in (before 4pm) and we weren't able to check in till the latest check-in because our room needed to be inspected. We were also asked to pay more at check-in for ""more taxes."" The staff was a bit rude to us. We paid for an ocean view and was placed in the motel..."
"I really enjoyed myself. Room was nice and clean we stayed in the Tides building. Very economical stay. The oceanfront view was amazing. The only drawback was the big outdoor hot tub was filthy. The water was like cold bath water, and the indoor pool enclosure was stinky."
This is a copy of the email I sent them after my stay. I did not receive a response from the resort.....
The group with us had a very interesting talk about the life and habitat of the sea turtle. The young lady in charge could not be stumped by any question that was asked by the group on the topic.
The sea turtles were amazing! A free look around at these sea turtles were memorizing. Thank you guys for saving these turtles and helping them out! 😃
"Enjoyed visiting the sea turtle sanctuary and learning about these interesting animals. Watched Gerry ,a very large sea turtle, eat his lunch. This organization takes in stranded and wounded turtles. They release them when they are well. Some are not able to be released, thus make their home there."
"Sea Turtle, Inc is a rescue facility. There are numerous tanks with various sea turtles that have been injured and rescued. Some are so severely injured that they would not be able to survive in the wild, so are kept at the rescue facility or adapted out at various aquariums. It's free or feel free to leave a donation, so..."
"We decided to check this place out because the lady at the KOA told us about it, and I'm glad we did. It is so cool to see all of the turtles swimming in the tanks. I love that they are saving the lives of turtles. It was very educational and the kids really got to learn a lot. (So..."
"It's really neat to see all of the different sea turtles that the rescue center has helped! They have one turtle in particular named Alison who had lost a flipper and the staff rigged up a device that attaches to her and helps her to swim. Kind of like the ""Dolphin Tale"" movie but with a sea turtle instead :)..."
The staff was very friendly and informative. You can see the turtles up close and take pictures easily. No admission fee but donations are accepted.
This was my first time to the rescue center. I arrived 15 minutes before the fed the turtles. This was a fun event to watch. The turtles are easy to see. There are signs by each tank explaining the history of the turtles and their prognosis. You can take all the pictures you want. A guide presents a nice 15...
Sea turtles up close. Informative staff. I actually learned a lot. No entrance fee but donations were appreciated.
"A "" must see"" for anyone with a heart and brain. The staff knew plenty if details, and fed them for us. Nice gift shop also. Please make a donation."
"I've been going to a convention at this hotel for the last four years, and every year Daniel Saumell is behind the bar. He not only remembers me and my husband, but he knows Ron is a Bud light guy, and asks us about our grandchildren. He's family to us! It's great to go away and see a familiar face...."
I visited this hotel in late January 2016. I am a frequent visitor to the Orlando area but this is my first time in the SeaWorld area. The lobby of the hotel is beautiful but there are signs of wear and tear with cracked marble and carpet in the hallways that is fraying. The room was above average in size....
"I panicked for a short time when my luggage became missing after checking in for a convention stay. J.V. came to our rescue. He worked diligently to find my luggage. After going to each room that checked in the same time I did, he found my luggage delivered by accident to an empty room. If it weren't for J.V. I..."
"The best location if you are in Orlando to visit SeaWorld, literally across the parking lot. Nice accommodations, clean, comfortable. Massive lobby, very on pointe for large conferences. Food was mediocre, but ok. Staff was very friendly and accommodating."
"I just concluded a 6 night stay here and although the rooms and hotel were nice, everything else was over the top ie drinks, food etc"
I had a challenging stay at the Renaissance Orlando at SeaWorld.
"This is a great property, well-maintained, conveniently located and affordable. The staff are the greatest asset to the Renaissance and each interaction proved it."
"The rooms in this beautiful hotel are spacious and clean. The public areas are very pleasant and staff are friendly. There are two specific points to improve; the signage of parking for guest checking in (we were lost for the first day accessing at least two parking lots) and the quality of catering, which I think can be improved taste-wise."
"nice hotel conveniently located close to I drive attractions, Orlando Eye restaurants etc."
"At suggestion of friends, stopped at the Center while staying on the Island. We were lucky to arrive at a feeding time and the worker was gracious enough to take just the two of us in to watch her feed one of the residents. Also got to see a surgery going on in the operating theater. Workers were extemely knowledge..."
It's a wonderful learning center that teaches how to help and rescue turtles that are in trouble. It also explains how we can do our part to help these endangered species. Great hands-on activities.
The people that work here a fantastic job working with injured and sick sea turtles not only from Georgia but all over the US. See the animals be treated by the staff is something special. Superb!
"Can I just say THANK YOU to all of you working and volunteering your time here. What a fantastic job you do at helping these helpless, injured, beautiful sea turtles. I am so glad I stopped. This is an excellent stop for families as well as adults without kids. It's educational, interactive, and an exemplary example of how we should..."
"My friend and I took the behind the scene tour and was definitely worth the money -- besides, the fee goes toward a good cause. We had a chance to watch the staff clean and stitch up a wound on a turtle's flipper. The work they do to save and rehabilitate injured turtles and terrapins is amazing."
"While we weren't certain what to expect on our visit here, it was all exceeded! First the place is in a historic building that once housed the power plant for the island, which is really cool. Then the place has an above average gift shop, and the people there are just awesome. Great information from the staff, they are all..."
"Not only is the Georgia Sea Turtle Center an educational experience, it's a fun one too. You're given a card after you pay your admission and then you ""journey"" through 5 stations. Your selections determine the lifespan of the turtle, where the nest was laid, etc. There is a hospital that you can visit and see a variety of turtles...."
Bring the kids here! They can visit the gift shop and pick a card that tells a story of a rescue turtle and they can follow his journey.. Of courses they will want to buy something but lots of cute books and educational things to choose from there.
"Fascinating place all about turtles and this place,s efforts to save and protect them.A nice gift shop area with various trinkets and shirts and books."
We visited for the third time and we're surprised at over 20 sea turtles and 3 more coming. We visited the first year and it's amazing how many they have released since then.
"The park was nice and clean, pretty spendy but includes all the rides. Concessions-few were open due to the time of year, no waiting in lines at any of them including the rides. Paid extra for close parking, worth it. Dissaponted in that we didn't have enough time to visit all the attractions due to the reduction in hours due..."
This was our first time at Sea world &amp; what a beautiful day it was. A fun day for all ages . We were there in the first week of December 2015 &amp; even though it was winter we had a beautiful warm sunny day. We arrived at opening time &amp; spent the whole day until closing time . I...
I have loved SeaWorld since I was a child. Was very excited to share it with my family. We went during the week when there were no crowds. Nice relaxing day! Enjoyed learning about all the wonderful animals.
Great day at sea world. We were very taken with the relationship that is obvious between the animals and staff. Killer whale show is a must do.
Every experience was impressive. The staff is super friendly and exceptionally knowledgeable and on brand. I learned so much about conservation and Sea World's commitment to sustainability. Fun for the entire family. We traveled on a Thursday which I highly recommend to avoid lines and be able to absorb the experience fully.
"I love taking my family to SeaWorld because I know it will be a fun day filled with memories. Even more than this, there are plenty of ways to become more informed as to how you can help these wonderful animals."
Our family group of 6 adults and 6 children visited SeaWorld in January. It was quite a cold day so there were not a lot of people My husband and I had visited in August a few years ago and noticed a big difference in attendance. Some of the attractions were closed for renovation and a lot of the eateries...
Lots of attractions to see and well worth the effort.
"My daughter and I spent a day at Sea World while visiting San Diego and had a very good time walking around and checking out the various attractions, shows, and exhibits. It was a bit more expensive than we expected but it was worth it to have that time together."
"This was a fantastic day, the kids loved seeing all the animals and we're excited to go on the rides"
"We loved the grounds and the room. Service wasn't helpful but we counted on the bell staff. Location is next to sea world, but you are completely on your own for getting to and from seaworld.... Staff won't help you.... but the Bell staff might. Expect a line for the concierge. Pool is excellent and well kept. Good food. Rooms..."
I think the for most thing I noticed about the hotel was that the staff were very friendly and we're always ready to help out wit any issues. The room service was also consistent. There was also lots of activities on the grounds to keep one entertained. The hotel is definitely not cheap but it's worth it personally.
Since we arrived everything was amazing. We were treated excellently by everyone front the staff and all of them were very efficient. The rooms were neat and comfortable. The hotel itself is brilliantly designed and the pools are just perfect.
This resort is nothing more than average. After checking in and advising we were not interested in time share we still received the call every morning at 8:20 which I so politely picked up and hung up each time (this is better than having to tell them off!). I'm on vacation I do not want to get a call at...
"So excited to have booked another stay at this fabulous property. We have stayed here twice in the past two years and when booking a trip to Orlando, we could not resist booking here again. We have stayed in both the two bedroom and three bedroom units and both were fabulous. We will be a party of 6 this time..."
"everything was wonderful here. staff, villa, food. couldn't ask for a better family vacation/stay!! beautiful groups, a lot of avtivies, the pools were beautiful. great place for family vacation. lots to do here on the resort."
"We had a 1 bedroom condo for the two of us. We enjoyed our stay. Our condo was a little dark (we looked out on the tropical wooded area near the lake) during the day, but we weren't in it that much. We found the staff very friendly and helpful. Check in was speedy, check out easy. The grounds were..."
"Beautiful complex and well staffed. Ali at the restaurant was attentive, friendly and professional as were other servers when we visited. The team at the convenience store was always on task, friendly and helpful and the store looked fresh and ready each morning. The staff in the lobby were also alert and ready to assist whenever I visited the desks...."
"We stopped at HGV Seaworld Resort for 10 days in December. We travel to Orlando from the UK every year and have done so for over 20 years, so have stayed at a number of properties in the Orlando area. This was the first time we have stayed here and it certainly won't be the last! The whole experience was..."
"Great place. Walked here from pier 33 after the Alcatraz tour. Lovely places to eat, great shops and a Zoltar machine ( if your a fan of the film Big)! Great atmosphere, lovely friendly people, you can see the sea lions here also. Lovely way to spend a day"
"We walked pier 39. The best places to eat were right there. We tried several for different finger foods just to taste, we still did not get them all. Fun for the family. The air was cool and fresh."
"Anything you could want is on Pier 39. Great choice of restaurants and other food items, souvenirs and liked the 7D experience"
"Wonderful experience for tourists on a nice sunny day, walking down the pier and taking in all the sights and sounds. Plenty of stores to visit and places to eat."
"It was a fun walk down the pier. Things looked pricey like they always do in tourist traps, but it was still fun to see. the highlight was the sea lions. They were fun to watch and worth the time."
"A great spot to try out while in San Francisco, bustling, full of souvenir shops and restaurants. Make sure to walk all the way to the end as you'll get a great view of Alcatraz and the Golden Gate bridge."
Pier 39 is worth visiting at least once in the day and once the evening when you're in San Francisco. Good food and entertainment at all times.
"If you want to pay for overpriced food, and souvenirs visit Pier 39. There were a lot of other nicer places to visit in San Fran than Pier 39. Definitely go and check it out but then leave quickly."
"Lots to see and do! A great way to enjoy shopping, food and the waterfront. Plenty to do for kids and adults. A short walk from the Ferry Building- walk or take a street car- great spot to spend the better part of a day."
There is so much more to Pier 39 than the sea lions. I was amazed by just how much is on the pier. There is something for everybody. food and drink on offer would make everybody happy there is something for everybody and a visit to the fudge shop on the pier is a treat for children and adults
"After having lunch overlooking the cove, we went down to see what was happening. We were surprised to see seals and sea lions basking in the sun and lolling on the beach. We were able to get up close to these animals. An experience not to be missed"
It was fun to see all of the sea lions lounging on the sand and hillside. The waves were really strong due to an incoming storm so there was very little beach to enjoy.
A bit smelly from the birds and animals but a great spot to visit and take photos. Don't approach the seals though...
We sat here for a couple of hours just to catch the sun set. Very lovely. You can park in the streets around. Lots of people walking.
La Jolla cave is a lovely small ocean side park. There are clean restrooms. Sea Lions sun on the rocks and the beach area. You can get close enough for some photos if you are careful not to disturb the wildlife. There is a small sandy beach area and a small cave to explore.
Easily accessible from walkway above. You can look over this colony of Seals and the magnificent ocean views. Love this place!
We really enjoyed our mid-morning stop at the Cove during our January trip to sunny southern California. There are lots of sea lions just laying around sunning themselves.
We walked on La Jolla cove last night just as the sun was setting and witnessed a most beautiful sight. This is the reason we chose to vacation at La Jolla this year. We hope to see many more such sunsets until we reach the sunset of our life.
It was a wonderful experience seeing all the sea lions as well as the Being beautiful.. It's a wonderful stroll with multiple restaurants in and eating outside was magnificent especially with the view ..
"Great bird and seal watching. December through May the beach is closed to people and dogs, as it becomes a seal nursery!"
We are here a few times for dinner and once for breakfast since it was so close to where we were staying. The macadamia crusted mahi mahi was absolutely divine. I had the pasta and was not as impressed for the price. Breakfast there was a lot less expensive and much greater portions. The macadamia banana pancakes were delicious. We...
"We booked a reservation for dinner at this restaurant and we're not disappointed. Though somewhat pricey, the service was excellent and the food delicious. The additional bonus are the views of the beach and small bay. If visiting Maui this should be a restaurant to consider."
Hard to beat the value you get with the Early Bird menu's three choices. Salad and dessert are included for $38. Great views indoor or outside. Just order between 5:30 - 6:00.
Great prime rib and lobster and shrimp Mac and cheese! Best view of the sunset at dinner! Great service and wonderful ambiance!
"Though staying at Napili Kai, we waited until late in our stay to dine just down the hill from our condo. It was worth the wait! The menu was more varied than many in Maui, and be advised there are early bird dining specials for anyone wanting to get in before 6:00 pm. The bar features it's Mai Tais, and..."
Have dinnered here for many years. Missed last year and this year for first time in many restaurant was less than full. Appears happy hour in adjacent area is more active. It was jammed for the hour before dining seating started and then nearly empty. Our food and service not up to prior levels. View continues to be OUTSTANDING
"This is one of our favorite restaurants in Maui. It's about an hour drive from Wailea but well worth it. It is located 30 feet from a beautiful tranquil bay and beach with swimmers, snorkelers and paddle boarders putting on a show! The food was excellent the service friendly, prompt and very good. The view was incredible and the sound..."
Went here for my husband's birthday while on Maui. Food was good and very prompt. Desserts were wonderful.
We stopped here on the recommendation of our front desk hostess at our hotel. We stopped during happy hour and ordered wings and coconut shrimp. The wings were so delicious we ordered another plate. They were cooked nice and crispy just the way we like them. 3 drinks and 3 appies were under 40 dollars. Very reasonably priced with good...
Went there yesterday for Happy hour and had the pork tacos and crab cakes. Very good. Best Happy hour offerings that we have found. Breakfast there today was scrumptious. I had Ail'a which is a baked egg dish and my husband had chocolate macadamia nuts pancakes. Also very good. Enough left over for breakfast tomorrow. Beautiful views of ocean from...
"I really love this place it's far enough away from ocean ave but right I'm the middle of Collins and Washington there's a great 24 hour resturaunt across the street the pool and beach area is so nice and quite the food,service and atmosphere is 5 star the only down side to this and any hotel in a metropolis area..."
"Older art deco hotel on south beach. Beautiful pool and garden area, with back gate to boardwalk and beach. You can rent chairs and/or little cababa covers on the beach."
we arrived a little early and the person at the desk said just give me a few minutes. 20 minutes later I asked her what was going on - she was texting on her phone - oh I will check - and give me a few minutes. About 10 minutes later we had a room - no one offered to...
"OUTSTANDING location. This small hotel on a sliver of prime real estate includes everything you need for a perfect vacation. From the street to the beach: 1) you are greeted by an expert staff who says ""yes"" to your requests, halls are lined with wonderful photos of old Miami Beach, 2) the room is clean and quiet and the bath..."
Great access to ocean
"Couldn't ask for a better location - right on the beach on Collins Ave. Nice pool area, nice access to the beach walk, friendly and helpful staff. Great area. The decor is in need of improvement. But for the price, a great value."
"This hotel is directly on the beach in my favorite part of SoBe - a little north, but still within walking distance, of Ocean Drive. I like being here because you can walk to the madness of Ocean Drive if you want to, but you can also escape it when you want to. The hotel is an older art deco..."
"I have stayed at the South Seas at least a half dozen times. It's a great location in the Heart of South Beach on Collins Ave, walking distance to everything. Nice little pool/bar area out back, steps from the beach with a free chair rental (umbrella is extra). Free Continetal Breakfast each morning until 10am. The rooms are small ,..."
Excellent location for a beach site. Room was just right for 2 people. All staff members greeted us throughout the day with a friendly and professional manner.
this was by far the best excursion we have been on. very funny and informative men telling their fishing stories. eagles galore. nice tiny gift shop on board. comfy seats. snacks were giving to us at end of tour. you do not go out into Bering sea. they stay in inside passage. we felt no waves or rises from water...
This crew was very friendly and helpful. The ship was well equipped with raincoats and galley seating for viewing. The tour was well planned and informative. Guests were encouraged to interact with the animals up close and personal. Restrooms were available as well as hot coco in the gift shop. Would definitely recommend for all ages.
Booked this excursion while on our Alaska cruise. Cheaper to book direct thatn through the cruise line.
"This is a fantastic, must-do tour. The captain and crew all have first-hand experience in sailing and fishing in the dangerous Bering Sea. They have a wealth of knowledge on the sea, boats and the fishing industry, for which they also hold a great passion. Their stories are funny, interesting and often quite moving. They also display great respect for..."
Really enjoyed the tour on the boat and the crew were very informative and fun. The boat was very comfortable and it was very cold they day we did the tour and they supplied lovely warm parker type jackets which made a difference. They explained how the Fisherman on the Deadliest Catch work and the difficulties they face. They had...
This is a must see in Ketchikan! The staff is awesome and very friendly. You get to see lots of wildlife! It's definitely something you have to go see! Your family will be talking about it for years!
This tour was definitely the best of all the excursions that we took on our Alaska cruise.
"entering, educating, thrilling, beautiful, the information supplied by the WHOLE crew was outstanding, the scenery was beautiful, the stop at the eagles just took my breath away there are not enough words to accurately describe the experience of a lifetime with this trip"
"This tour is the best of both worlds. The crew: experienced, lively and full of information and stories about the ups and downs of fishing life. The boat: Workhorse turned comfortable touring rig. Seating on the upper and lower decks (with heating lamps!), hot beverages, and one of the nicer bathrooms on a boat I've ever encountered. The Bering Sea..."
This even was fun and educational. The crew relate d real life experiences they had fishing the Bearing Sea -- Incredible!!!
"It was the highlight of our trip to Kona. When we were there they had high surf advisory and it was the best way to snorkel at ""2 step"". We were so lucky to snorkel there and have 3 turtle sighting. Steve told us the best places to snorkel and he was right on the mark. Captain Cook was fantastic..a..."
"Great trip on Zodiac so not good for seasick prone travelers. Small group experience. Captain Jenna and sidekick Michael were kind, friendly, professional and really knew their stuff! Showed us sights along the way with historical and geological information. This is the best snorkel tour I have been on by far and will definitely do it again!"
The staff and crew are excellent. The directions are easy and there is ample parking near the dock and harbor. All the equipment to snorkel is provided including prescription googles at no extra charge. They use rigid hull inflatable rafts. I am a woman in my 60's and I had no problem riding on the raft or getting in or...
Captain Steve and assistant Kevin were great. We did the South Kona expedition and it was about 5 hrs. On this trip you visit Kealakekua Bay (Captain Cook) &amp; Honaunau Bay. Just to clarify you can visit these sites on your own you can park at Honaunau Bay and you can hike in to Captain Cook however the hike is...
"I have been on several snorkeling adventures, Sea Quest was by far the best. Our boat was a smaller boat with fewer people, 14 was max, but we only had 8-snorklers, which made it even better. Captain Steve was great, very knowledgeable about Hawaiian history, geography, and sea life. We snorkeled in three great places, visited sea caves, saw lava..."
"Amazing crew, great lunch, beautiful boat ride...snorkeling was great even though I got queasy and couldn't fully participate (my fault, not theirs) ...my son had a great time. Crew is very attentive and knowledgeable...highly recommend. ..aloha and mahalo"
"Our 3 stop snorkeling tour was on 1/21. Although the water was a little choppy, Captain Kendra made the trip fantastic. We saw lots of great coral reefs, turtles, and even played with dolphins swimming along with the boat. Our group had some special needs, and they were handled very well. Everyone was made to feel special and welcome. This..."
We had a great time on this trip
I went on two snorkeling trips with Sea Quest and they were both totally fantastic: the three snorkel trip and the mantra ray night snorkel.
"This was our second trip with Sea Quest to Captain Cook Monument. Both trips were excellent. We saw whales and dolphins and had a very nice snorkel. Both trips had wonderful Captains and were not too crowded. On our most recent trip, Kendra was very adept at spotting whales - we saw seven. I would highly recommend this trip to..."
"When you book this be sure to ask for Shawn and CJ! The tour is fun, but these two have a ton of local knowledge and are a blast! The surf was a bit rough, so the snorkeling was only ok, but the rest or the trip made it all worth it anyway. Saw Dolphins, whales, turtles and incredible shoreline..."
"This guys are top notch. Great trip out to snorkel, then up the Napali Coast and back with plenty of whales and dolphins to view on the way. Most important for this review is the crew was awesome. Captain Jeff and company were great. Only thing that was rough on this trip was the waves and a little bit of..."
Snorkel with sea turtles? Check. See whales? Check. Baby whales? Check. Watch spinner dolphins dance around the boat? Check. Bottlenose dolphins on the way back? Check.
Visited Kauai in January 2016 an took this tour. The land staff and crew were fantastic.
"Just finished our Na'Pali cost snorkel tour with Kauai Sea Tours and had a great time. Our captain, Kauai, was both entertaining and knowledgeable, sharing a great deal of information on Kauai spcifically and Hawaii in general. Due to many days of rough water, the visibility at the snorkel location was not great, but was to be expected given the..."
"As our time on Kauai was winding down we had to get out on the water. We had originally booked with Captain Andy's to go up the Na Pali coast for the sunset cruise, but due to the high swells, they changed the tour to the south coast. Kudos to them for giving us a full refund so we could..."
"Went during winter (January) and just happened to pick a great day to go. The ocean was a little rough, but overall very tolerable. The crew made sure everyone was taken care of. We snorkeled for about 45-60 minutes. Saw a few turtles while snorkeling. After the snorkeling, we went to the Na Pali Coast. We saw humpback whales, dolphins,..."
"This 6 hour tour was an amazing trip. The captain and his crew were first rate. While the big catamaran still bounced around in the waves, overall we had great views from the upper deck. We saw dozens of whales, a pod of spinner dolphins, and a ses turtle up close while snorkeling. The kids, 10 &amp;11 had a blast...."
"We took this boat/raft ride up along the Na Pali coast. The sights were really beautiful, we even came upon a pod of spinner dolphins! The trip was a little roughter than expected (although we were warned, but we were given the ""same"" warnings on other tours we took that turned out to be really tame, so take this warning..."
There are several companies to choose from to visit the Napoli coast by boat. We reviewed all of them before we left for the island and selected Kauai Sea Tours as the day and time were the best choice and we weren't disappointed at all with our selection. The trip was awesome and visiting in January we also had the...
"Great place to take kids, and well worth it, but not world class in size, but interesting and fun nevertheless."
"This feels like a 'small town' effort for an aquarium. The exhibits are somewhat repetitive, and for the most part not particularly impressive. There is a smallish area for touching some sea creatures. Little kids probably like it more than older ones. Admission for adult was over $20."
This place is great for kids. They let you touch just about all the animals.
"I really don't know its better than others, I don't go often to aquariums but its really nice to go there with children, they enjoy it very much."
"A nice aquarium - no large fish, but a great environment for kids. We were two adults and the guides were excellent, but the entire environment were really gearded for kids."
"Entry fee is really expensive for this venue and the attractions/exhibits are really average. We've visited several aquariums around the country and was really surprised by how small, expensive and lacking this aquarium felt. I'd skip it and go to Woodland Zoo instead. Currently the location is difficult due to all the construction around it so it really did turn..."
We had so much fun. It was our Anniversary and the last 2 times we had been in Maui and I got a fresh flower lei. Well it was Hawaii days and they were handing them out as we entered. It was perfect. We loved all of the exhibits. We need to go again.
I am from Alask and we have the Alaska Sea Life Center which is amazing but I really enjoyed the Seattle Aquarium. When we walked in we immediately saw a diver inside the huge fish tank in the lobby and it was quite interesting to hear the narrator talking about the feeding time and giving amazing facts about the fish...it...
"There is everything here! I love the otters and sea lions. They are so cute, energetic and fun. My kids loved it!"
"Never actually made it inside. There was a long line in pouring rain. Everyone could have stoop under an overhang alongside the building, but they made you stand in the rain instead. They put up a sign saying also enter using south entry, when I went there the doors were locked and you could not get in that way. I..."
"Stayed here for the first time in Suite 7. Very centrally located to restaurants, downtown &amp; other attractions. The staff was very friendly &amp; welcoming. The view is beautiful, even on a rainy day. The Inn provides a wonderful mini breakfast every morning &amp; binoculars to whale watch! Fairly quiet for having adjoining walls to the suites."
Our first time to Mendocino and couldn't have picked a better place to stay!
"Sea Rock Inn was truly a wonderful experience. The owners were very welcoming, helpful and kind. The breakfast each morning was delicious, they had coffee tea and brownies all day, movies to choose from and lots of travel info. We also had the option of bringing the breakfast to our room which was nice. We stayed in Suite 12 and..."
Just a very peaceful and quiet place to get away from all of the regular daily grinds of life. A place where you can be one with nature and enjoy the beauty of the Pacific Ocean. A great getaway for anniversary or honeymoon or just to rest.
"First off, the Sea Rock Inn is gorgeous. Fantastic view, charming rooms, perfect little getaway. But what really impressed us was how great the staff was: friendly, professional and very helpful. Would definitely come back!"
"Fabulous place - with lovely cottages and lots of thoughtful amenities, perched on a hillside overlooking the ocean. We savored the tasty breakfast while watching the ocean mist receding. The management was friendly and helpful - I highly recommend it!"
"What a great little getaway spot. The views from our room were unbelievable (we were there during the harvest moon so the evening was just as delightful). The service was great (Norman is awesome!), and the food was tasty! The room was great and the bed was cozy. It's located just close enough to walk to down-town (if you're a..."
"We've been coming to the Searock for 20 years now and it is a family tradition for very good reason: it is a truly relaxing and beautiful getaway that we always look forward to, and we have never once been disappointed. We will continue coming here for many years to come!"
"Located on a bluff overlooking the crashing Pacific, the Inn offers guests unrivalled comfort and convenient access to downtown Mendocino in well appointed suites and cottages. We opted for Cottage 10, set beside the lobby and close to the road but equipped with its own parking, practical for unloading large cases."
"We loved this little beach hotel. The room was updated, clean, super comfy bed, loved it so much! The location is literally steps from the beach. There's a boardwalk up and down the beach that goes quite a long way, and is full of walkers, runners, bikes and skateboards, very lively. Great people watching. If we stayed there again we..."
"Our entire experience was wonderful - Blake's friendly and helpful assist with our reservation process; Ashley and other front desk staff being super friendly and helpful (where to eat, how to get our Uber ride, how to use the Mac to print our airline tickets); the always smiling housekeeping staff; and even the quick return by mail of the item..."
"Definitely the best thing about this place is the location, right off the beach, with many great restaurants and bars within walking distance. I was in a room billed as ""partial ocean view,"" but it actually looked directly out across the pool to the ocean (in their picture, taken from the beachwalk, look across the pool to the second floor)...."
"My wife and I came to LA to watch a Lakers game but had two days to kill, decided San Diego wasn't too far away. Briefly looked at some places and saw this one, drove there and walked in to check out rooms and availability. A little skeptical from the outside but had read the place had been renovated and..."
Love this place the staff was very friendly and professional the view is spectacular sunrise and the sunset never wanted to leave easy access to walking to the beach lots of restaurants nearby and shopping the hotel is nice and clean
"So this is an old hotel that has been renovated on the inside. The rooms have an IKEA furnished feel, with some Surf theme art work on the walls. I felt like the hotel is trying its best to keep the old building going by renovating the rooms, but it's hard to overcome the overall shape and age/condition of the..."
"my girlfriend and i had a great stay here. it started out with the awesome front desk service from jeff. room was very nice and clean. we didnt need to drive our car anywhere because this hotel is in the heart of the beach community. i really like staying here,and will be back on my next visit to san diego."
My wife and I passed three days after Christmas at this property. What a great place! We sprung for a beach-side room; the patio looked over the walking path along the Mission Beach with views to the Crystal Pier and constant action. The staff were very helpful and the parking in the garage with elevator access to rooms made it...
"This was our second visit to the Blue Sea. The rooms are clean, the staff is wonderful, it's right on the beach, and the surrounding neighborhood is walkable for dinner, drinks, etc. My husband was there for a conference in San Diego (at the Town and Country in Hotel Circle) and it was very easy to navigate back and forth..."
My husband and I came here for the fried clams. They were yummy. No frills but that's what helps to keep the prices reasonable.
"This is our fifth trip to Hilton Head, and had never found the Sea Shack before. People at our church recommended it, so we had GPS show us where it is. Of course we missed the ""order food before going to a table"" sign, but other diners were courteous enough to fill us in. We found the person taking our..."
"Ate at the Sea Shack based on the reviews on trip adviser during my weeklong stay on Hilton Head in January. Needed a quick bite to eat, got there right at 11:00 during the week before the crowd arrived. Wanted fried fish, I had catfish and my wife had flounder. Well seasoned and cooked. Huge portions, inexpensive. Exactly as advertised."
"Hole in the wall eatery with lackluster staff - but it's the best seafood on island!! If you don't care about service, you won't be disappointed!"
Very good fried seafood but...
"The Sea Shack has no pretensions. It does have great fresh fish, fried, grilled, or blackened. Most of the folks I saw, and I myself, were eating our fish fried."
"Agree with Rob's review! excellent food, prepared and served very simply. Just good seafood at very reasonable prices."
"First off, this is not a fancy place. If you are trying to impress a gorgeous, snooty, drama queen, go somewhere else. There are no white linen tablecloths here. There aren't any waitresses to take your order here (You order at the cook's station, a hairy-armed waiter will deliver your meal to you at your blue and white checkered table,,,,,,,,,..."
Definitely not fine dining. Plastic plates and cutlery. Small with about 10 tables. If you enjoy fish. Chowder etc. you will enjoy the food. No atmosphere or ambiance. Enjoyed the experience for one time.
"Used the carryout service. Service was fast and efficient. Good size portions. Food was excellent. The catfish dinner is very good, will order it again."
"I was reminded of that wonderful line by someone who said, 'people go to Naples because they think they are old and rich but when they get there they realize they are neither'. The restaurant prices reflect the huge amount of disposable income that floods into the town in the winter months. The Sea Salt caters to these people and..."
"Unbelievably bad service. Menu and food were fine but the server basically ruined our meal. Here are the highlights - didn't know anything about the menu, drinks took forever to be ordered and come out, food came out to fast once it came - didn't have time to finish our courses, server placed food down on table then served other..."
"One of the highlights of Salt is the oyster menu- rotating options from all over the world, depending on what is in season."
"Located in Olde Naples, Sea Salt is an excellent choice for lunch, and presumably dinner. I met 2 other friends there for a business lunch. The staff was very helpful and never rushed us even though we sat there for an extra long time to finish up our business. My only complaint was that the caesar salad had too much..."
"Sea Salt has it all. Nice ambience, whether inside or out, and great food and wine. And some nice unique touches."
Lovely setting in the middle of the trendy 3rd St. area. Great seafood - broad selections - had a wonderful swordfish that was melt in the mouth tender (and this dish can be challenging to keep moist and tender). Outstanding wine list - especially Italian and Spanish selections) with knowledgable sommelier. Highly recommended - can be crowded - tables seated...
"We can never get enough fresh local fish and in our opinion Sea Salt is the best in Naples! They start you off with bread, olive oil and three salts from around the world. Fun to compare and try. Today, our favorite was a pink Hawaiian salt but the sulphur salt from India was the most unusual we've had. We..."
"In coming to the US one has to recalibrate, all but a very few restaurants actually serves European aka French standard haute cuisine."
"Went today for lunch. Currently running a special at the bar. A glass of house wine and a burger for only 12.95. In Naples that's a bargain. The burger is usually 14.00 and the wine 10.00. Ok, the usual price is too high BUT on special, it brings it down to MCD range! Oh yea, if you don't like burgers,..."
"Arrived with a reservation for a party of four. Dinner. Everyone of us loved the food. The fish was prepared perfectly. Of everywhere we have eaten in downtown Naples this place surpasses them all. Service great, wine selection good. Ambiance nice. Will take guests here again. One of the few worth the price tag."
"Beautiful setting for intimate wedding. Sage, event planner, was wonderful and flexible with the ever-changing weather. Food so delicious. Very comfy bedding and rooms so peaceful. Wood walkways did make for noisy footsteps, but overall-excellent"
"I love Sea Ranch -- the grounds are beautiful, the rooms are rustic and charming. The beds are super comfortable. It's the staff that makes the place mediocre. Upon checkout they didn't ask how the stay was. I let them know that I'd stayed in the same room 8 months prior, and the heater still made loud noises every time..."
Marvelous find on the North Central Coast
"Great weekend getaway, fantastic setting, amazing property and chill vibe. The staff presents as unhappy and not so helpful but it didn't matter because we got lost in the tranquility surroundings. We will go back."
It was our first time at Sea Ranch. I know it was older but was looking forward to the rustic rooms. We got there in time for a glass of wine and apps. The wines were ok and probably not the right temp. It was $50. The waitress forgot my soup twice as she came to our table for something...
"The lodge has been nicely updated and well maintained since I was last here about 20 years ago. The setting is still spectacularly beautiful, peaceful, and wild -- it's a great place to sit and read, stare at the waves or walk the miles of coastal trails. Best of all, it's a pet-friendly place! The rooms are simply but elegantly..."
"Such a beautiful and peaceful place. I loved the style of the town and of the lodge. This would have been one of our fav hotels except for 2 things: 1) our room had a very, very funky smell that did not subside 2) restaurant left some to be desired, and it's the only option in town."
"Very much enjoyed my stay. I'm not sure that I agree with this review policy requiring 200 characters, I assume I'm almost over that number now; oh, 52 to go. well I definitely enjoyed my stay more than this part of the evaluation."
I've stayed at Sea Ranch now four times and I would definitely go back - the property is a bit dated but it has a fun quaint feel to it and the rooms with fireplaces really add an element to the otherwise rustic feel.
Great aquarium but make sure you make reservations in advance for the feeding frenzy tour. That was the highlight of our visit. You get to go feed the fish before the aquarium opens to the public. Well worth the extra price.
"We used to have memberships to the aquarium and went much more often, but haven't kept it up the last two years. This day we went on a homeschool day and really appreciated the hospitality of the Aquarium staff to all the groups. They were not only welcoming and happy to have our students, but they had extra exhibits from..."
"The Monterey Bay aquarium was one of the best attractions we visited on our trip. This place is quite big, so allow at least 2 hours for a visit, probably more if you are taking children. We were given celebration pins at the front desk when they heard it was our honeymoon, and all the staff offered their congratulations as..."
"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is an amazing resource you should not pass up. There is so much to do, so much to learn and so much to gaze upon that one could spend days there and not see it all. Be aware, it is very crowded most day but especially during the summer months. There are many children running around,..."
"It's expensive however, the fee goes to the preservation of the facility as well as food for the animals and staff who were very friendly and helpful."
"The docents are among the best anywhere. We've been here starting in 1989, sometimes multiple times a year, and EVERY trip, we learn something new."
This place was so beautiful and amazing. The aquarium is not Similar to anything i have seen before. It is a Nice place things are organized and You get information about everything. But Only 3 star because of the price. It is very expensive just for watching.
On this rainy cold day we were not able to visit the aquarium. because I have a small poodle that would be contain in a stroller which I was told pets would not be allowed. The aquarium lost $120 from us.
"This really was above our expectations! It was just a really cool place, so informative on the sea life of the area and trying hard to teach about the hazards of pollution on our environment!"
"Forget about Fisherman's Wharf and go straight here. A world class aquarium with excellent interpretive experiences for all ages. The tickets aren't cheap, but worth every penny. Store your belongings in the lockers across the street from the entrance."
The rooms are always clean and comfortable. I love the fact that it is several little buildings motel like but Best Western Style. So you walk out of your room right outside through beautifully manicured greenery that are tropical like and CA style.
Check in was very slow. We established credit with credit cards and we got this long explanation about how in addition to our room rate we were going to have $75 held on our credit cards for incidentals and damages. Made no sense in this day and age.
"The restaurant and bar were under reconstruction. A meeting room was thus used for the restaurant and another room for the bar. The rooms were clean and well put together. They looked very nice. A free breakfast was not available, but the food in the restaurant was very good and with the very inexpensive rate of the rooms, made the..."
"I stayed at the Best Western Seven Seas in San Diego on a Friday night in January, 2016. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable and the room was clean, comfortable and quiet. I was on the second floor. The original cafe on property was under rennovation. I got a great price on the room through Priceline. It was worth..."
"I stayed here for three nights, I actually just checked out an hour ago, I'm writing this review from the airport. I was in town to visit a few friends last minute and I needed something affordable, but I refuse to stay in a dump. This met both of my demands."
"This hotel served fine for the purposes I needed it for - somewhere to sleep, shower and dress as I left out early in the morning and returned late in the evenings. I decided to stay here based on free parking, the cost but mostly the free cancellation (booked via Expedia). There was a bit of a queue at check-in...."
"We enjoyed our recent stay at this hotel very much. Service and cleanliness were important to us - the hotel met both of those points, and more. The staff at this hotel was very helpful and accommodating, not just to us but also to other guests we noticed - excellent service. We were very comfortable with the room, it was..."
"Nice service, price and beautiful landscaping. Room is nice and clean. Great location and hotel landscape is beautiful especially at night. We come to visit our children often and will continue to stay here every time we come to San Diego."
Spent a couple of nights here during our stay in San Diego. The hotel is well located near attractions and shopping and easily accessible to highways. It is not a new facility but it appears to be cared for. Beautiful grounds with a nice pool area and two hot tubs. Very helpful staff and a clean facility. We were pleased...
"This wasn't bad for the money. It was an authentic luau complete with a stage performance led by the chef with music, native dances, audience participation, incredible acts with fire. Narration by the chef was quite funny at times and kept the audience fully engaged every minute. Sea Life Park itself needs updating."
"We wanted to see a luau and waited until the end of our two week stay in Hawaii. Chief's Luau is totally worth the visit! We booked online and got there in plenty of time. Before the meal they have activities for everyone (spear throwing, fire starting, grass weaving, etc). The meal was amazing, and the entertainment was hilarious and..."
"This was an amazing experience. Although we've been to a few luau before and this is the best, we've just been to a few. But we had the good fortune to sit next to a couple who have been to dozens but this was the first time to this one. They said they've never experienced any even close to as..."
"We had a fabulous evening with our family - best luau every. Extremely entertaining, high energy performers, very interactive. So glad we were able to attend. Ames, Iowa"
Chief's Luau was GREAT! The Chief is a great entertainer and his staff of Polynesian people was fantastic. I advice you to take a trip to the far side of the island for some great entertainment. The food is ok but the show is the greatest with the best views of the island
The show was high energy and brought a smile to your face. The food was tasty and show was excellent. Crowd participation was welcomed but not overdone and the Chief kept it moving along.
Great luau. The chief was a great MC and incorporated some humor into the show.
"The entertainment and setting more than justify the price. The food is only average, hence a 4 and not a 5. Polynesian culture and dance is well presented."
"I visited this attraction in August of 2013 when I got married in Hawaii. I always laugh about my experience here when I look back, but let me tell you, my wife and I were definitely NOT laughing while we in attendance. Quite simply, it was a waste of money."
The show overall was enjoyable. The mc made never ending sexual innuendo through the whole show. It stopped being funny fast and was really inappropriate for all the families present.
"Wonderful hotel...even in the off season - we felt like it was the busy season, as our room was exceptionally clean and the staff was present (our house-keeper was busy about the rooms, the gardener was trimming away expired plants and freshening up the grounds, the office staff was in the office and available) -- yet, it was nice and..."
"After doing a lot of research about where to stay in Cape May, before continuing our trip south by ferry, we finally settled on the Sea Crest because of its great location at one end of the beachfront road, and because of its low off-season price, of just $110 for an oceanview, king bedded room with balcony. Strangely enough, they..."
"No reservations online as far as I know, but the lady who took mine on the phone was very nice as were the ones when I checked in. They told me about the area and what was going on. Had a suite on the 2nd floor that overlooked the pool area and ocean view. Very roomy and clean room. Had..."
"We stayed in late Oct/Nov .. we had an ocean view. The hotel was very clean, the rooms were neatly put together and had what we needed. Our view was wonderful. The people at the desk were very nice. I'm sure summer rates are much higher, but for an off season trip - much cheaper than a B&amp;B and quite..."
"I agree this inn is indeed clean however, our room, one of their most expensive rooms, had a distinct musty, mildewy type odor. We tried opening the windows but like other viewers have mentioned we very quickly had a room filed with cigarette smoke."
"We wanted to book a last minute trip to Cape May, which seemed almost impossible. After looking at a lot of places, I stumbled upon the Sea Crest Motor Inn. From the reservation process to our whole stay, it was great. We loved our comfortable and functional room and can't wait to go back! We both agreed that this is..."
"Clean, comfortable ,relaxing and quiet.5th year going and it only gets better. Staff is very friendly and helpful ,they were spot on with their dining recommendations ,and very concerned that you are enjoying your stay. Calling for reservations is always like calling a friend. Thank-you for making our stay another great memory to cherish."
"We agree with many of the reviews about the positive aspects of Sea Crest Inn: the location, the cleanliness of the rooms, the free parking. The pool and hot tub were great. However, guests are allowed to smoke on the balconies, which are shared, and as a consequence, the smoking of neighbours constantly affected our air, whether we were on..."
"I reviewed the Sea Crest Inn last year, but I am happy to do it again. After visiting this August for my birthday, I continue to enjoy my stay. What's not to love: great location, a pool, and an adult crowd -- perfect for what I'm looking for in a summer getaway with my boyfriend. Everything you need like shopping..."
We stayed Jan 15-18 at this hotel. Upon checking in we went to our room and notice it was on the 2nd floor. We went back asked if we could be moved to a higher room as my wife and I just enjoy viewing the ocean. The kind staff not only moved us but upgraded our room to this magnificent...
We had a great time. It was cold outside as expected but the room was warm and cozy. It was clean and the staff was super nice. I will be planning another Winter vacation and we will surely stay here again.
"My friends and I spent New Years in Myrtle Beach and stayed here for my second visit. We had a Jr. Suite with an angle view of the ocean. Spacious, clean, and great views just like when I had stayed here before. The staff at the desk and housekeeping staff are so friendly and helpful. Parking was much more accessible..."
"Extremely clean, friendly and helpful staff, no complaints at all. Nice indoor heated pools that the kids loved. The text communication with the front desk was fantastic. Great location. We really enjoyed our stay here. Will definitely be back."
"I loved this place! It fit our needs to the tee. Our room had two beds in the first area, followed by a bathroom/kitchen and lastly, a separate sitting room with a couch and a pull down bed. I had my daughter, son in law and granddaughter stay in the bedroom area to give them privacy, and I stayed on..."
Decent price and good view. Balcony was nice to have and we enjoyed her indoor pool and hot tub. Felt clean. Staff was very friendly. Room was nice. Wish hot tub hours were extended for adults. We really enjoyed our stay. No complaints.
"We loved our room! Amazing view. The indoor and outdoor pools were awesome also. Very nice. We loved the private balcony and beds were very comfy. I also liked the fact it had a laundry room, as a mom that was a help."
"First and foremost, staff is very very friendly. The room was spacious and had two queen beds and a great view of the ocean. Nice efficient small kitchen, supplies in desperate need of updating. Bathroom show head terrible needed replacing. Towels were like sandpaper, but plentiful in room. We went to pools everyday over our four day stay, towels at..."
"Want to state upfront that the staff was friendly and very courteous. The resort itself, was outdated, hasn't been upgraded except for our bathroom. We stayed in 629 on 1/2/16 and will leave on 1/4/16. If the cancellation fee hadn't been so high, we would have left after arrival."
"Great day trip. Went on a rainy day. Much of it was under cover. Brought a rain poncho, worked well. Went through the whole place in about 2-3 hours. Fun!"
The Dolphin and the Sea Lion shows were simply great! My wife and my daughter also joined the Dolphin Encounter and they loved it!
We decided to try this out since it was a dry place to visit and we had a plane to catch. What a great place!! The shows were great and the people who work with the animals were so friendly! I also liked how they included the visitors. Most places like this are all about you just watching the animals....
"Everyone was super friendly and helpful. I was shocked at how pleasant and happy the staff and crew were, truly a family operated business."
I had driven past Theater of the Sea numerous times and finally decided to see what it was all about. What a nice surprise. The same family has owned the place for over 70 years. Originally it was one of Henry Flagler's quarries for stone to build the railroad. It was flooded and used as holding tanks for bottle nosed...
The beauty of this place is that they care for animals that would not survive if released.
It was kind of like an old school sea world. It was a cool place and the dolphin show was really fun. there were lots of fish and birds to see. Definitely a fun thing to do one morning or on a cloudy day. It's all outdoors so there's no a/c
We visited with our young son and he loved the dolphin and Sea Lion show so much he cried when we had to leave! Highly recommended!
"Went to this ""little sea world"" just looking for something to do with my last day in the Keys. But was very pleasantly surprised. The cast is very knowledgeable and passionate about what they are doing and the ""shows"" are entertaining and informative about conservation without being preachy. A good way to spend the day."
"When you love your job it shows and makes for a great ""theater"" experience. Truly enjoyed our visit here."
"We got to come to seaworld with our package from Discovery Cove. We really enjoyed the shows and had a lot od laughs. We came on a Saturday so it did get a little crowded but that was as to be expected. I loved that throughout the day you can get your pictures taken at different spots in the park,..."
"I went with my family in 2006. Then I went in 2009. Then I went in 2011. Then I went in 2013. Then I went in 2015. We go here a lot because of the many amazing rides and fun experiences that we've had. Shamu got water all over us, the rides were fun, and I'll never forget the time..."
We visited mainly for the penguins 🐧.
"I recommend to all families with young or old kids great for grandparents too.All the animals look well taken care of, the park was very clean and the food and snacks were great."
"The shows were amazing, well worth a visit. It was a very cold day but still lots of things to occupy us, would like to return on a warmer day..."
"It's tough to give this attraction 5 stars after having spent a day at Discovery cove first. Sea world is still a great place to spend a day and there are great shows to watch and the aquarium is really well done. The rides are good, not great."
We visited SeaWorld as part of an organized activity with a youth group we attend. It wa an extremely cold day in January.
"Had a great day at SeaWorld, enjoyed the shows. The park was very clean with a lot of food options. Enjoyed the rides and cant wait to come back."
My 8 year old son enjoyed all day and every attraction at this park.
excellent shows please check the times and dates.skating ice live animals show fireworks and well lit up.
"I mean you get to go down in the cave and look at all these ridiculous creatures! It's amazing. I've done this as a kid, and now twice as an adult, and will do it every chance I get when I visit Oregon! Birders will enjoy the close looks at Western Gulls, cormorants, and sparrows in the above ground section!"
The sea lion caves are truly unique and interesting to watch . Prices are a little spendy but you gotta do it at least once in your life! So take the kids for a fun adventure and enjoy the experience!
"I definitely would not miss this attraction. Yes, it's some climbing and a long elevator ride, however once there in the cave, the minute the first sea lion comes into view you'll forget how you got there. The seal's were having the most fun. Some catching waves just as they entered the cave, while others stayed in little ""cubby holes""..."
A lot of people complain this place is an overpriced tourist trap. I guess for them the idea of shelling out $14 to go see a big cave and some animals in their natural habitat is a bit too steep to stomach.
"Been here several times with my kids and visiting friends/family. It's an elevator ride 200 feet down into the caves where the sea lions live and sleep. If it's a sunny day you can find them out on the rocks sunbathing. It's a bit smelly,but the cave is interesting. There is also a gift shop for souveniers."
"The cave was so dark it was so hard to see the sea lions. It was smelly (which added to the authenticity). :o) We love wildlife, so this was a must see for our family. Just wished it wasn't so expensive to ride the elevator down. We spent a couple hours here, however. The gift shop could use an update!"
"My daughter and her husband along with my granddaughter and myself visited the Sea Lion Caves it was interesting the cave had only a couple sea lions, the majority were outside near the south walkway. I recommend binoculars or a camera with zoom as it was hard to see otherwise. It's a great travel destination if you like sea lions...."
"But we loved it. We are definitely off the beaten path type of travellers, but LOVE sea life so we thought what the heck. Definitely worth it. The smell wasn't that bad, ya go nose blind pretty quick, the noise wasn't deafening, actually kind of soothing and musical at points. The trip back up is steep but doable. Pricey at..."
"Definitely a tourist spot, but actually I don't mind them capitalizing on it! The fee is pricey, but you don't actually have to pay if you would just like to hike down a path you can view the sea lions on the beach for free, although you can't get that close. If you make the trip there, I'd suggest spending..."
I am so glad I did this. We went at high tide. The cave was quite full. The roaring to each other cant be described. It is dark so give your phone time to adjust to the lighting before shooting the picture. My videos turned out the best. It is cool to see these creatures in their natural habitat!
"After reading reviews we decided that this was a can't miss place for dining. The apps we ordered were disappointing...crab dip, She Crab soup and Clam Chowder. All were very unexciting. We all were expecting to be wowed. The hush puppies were great. Our server brought us the wrong bottle of wine and was very tacky in saying it was..."
"We come to this area several times a year and we always eat at the Sea Captain House. The food and atmosphere are great. We enjoy our breakfast experience, the gentleman cooking eggs at buffet makes you feel special, also knows his stuff. Would definitely recommend."
We went on a weekend so make sure to make reservations. I chose the chefs special and it was delicious. Also I tried the shrimp from someone else's plate. It was good also. Wait staff was friendly and efficient. It is a good place to visit while in Myrtle Beach.
I used to eat here in 70s...took my grandchildren.....great lunch prices and food was great....decor beautiful and restaurant is right on the beach! Dessert was awesome ( get the chocolate!!!!!!😍) highly recommended!
Wonderful place for seafood! We have eaten dinner here several time when we visit Myrtle Beach. Nice views and great food. Hush puppies are delicious. We would definitely recommend this restaurant.
"this is one of the best restaurants in Myrtle Beach. I got the Captain's Muddle. It was a a mixture of sea scallops, mussels, clams, some white kind of fish, shrimp, cubed potatoes and celery in a tomato saffron broth, Absolutely amazing. My hisband got the broiled seafood platter. He loved it."
"Always Great Food !!!! There Breakfast Buffett sooooooo Goodddddd!!!!!!!!! They also make fresh omlets, they have a station just for that at buffet. Also there coffee is always exellent!!!! Always very clean, Very Nice Staff!!! You can't beat the price either, Buffet $10.00 all you can eat. I'm a local , I've been going for years........ Great Going, Sea Captian's..."
"Just ate dinner at the Sea Captain`s House. My wife and I split an appetizer, seafood salad, , and the broiled seafood platter. Everything was great, and had no problem with ordering everything from their gluten free menu which my wife needs. It is the last day of January, so we had no problem getting right in. Views were spectacular...."
"We eat breakfast there everyday as it is part of the golf package we book. Their omelette bar is excellent and has many choices to fill those omelets with. They also have a breakfast bar to get cereal,bacon,scrambled eggs etc if you are in a hurry. You can also order off the menu if you so choose. Try the eggs..."
"My husband and I came to this restaurant twice recently and it was great both times. Local seafood, friendly servers and greeters, and great shrimp and grits. The view is nice as well!"
"Generally the staff was polite, and pretty laid-back as it was off season. The reception is in a building across from the street, and they do give military discounts.The room was clean. Housekeeping just came along in the afternoon to just exchange our wet towels for clean, fresh ones. The old reverse cycle AC was quite loud at night and..."
"Three day off season price was really great--very hard to beat. Hotel is old, but fine. Called 4 times for extra pillows. Alex and Jordan(?), I know you said you haven't forgotten about me, but been out of there about 2 weeks now, and never got those pillows! Probably should just mail 'em to me now. ;) Indoor hot tub..."
"Three of us stayed Jan. 1 &amp; 2, 2016 in an 'Ocean Side Family Suite' - 2 rooms with 1 Bath in the Dunes Building. One room was a bedroom with two double beds. The other room was a living room/kitchenette combination with a pull-down double wall bed. This room was located on the Ocean Side of the street with..."
Wouldn't stay here again this hotel needs to be updated. We called front desk to let them know we needed towels and washcloth didn't receive until the next morning we had to go to Walmart to buy our on. Then we had a room with the kitchenette didn't have no pots to cook in had to go buy that.This hotel...
"We were placed in a first floor room on the beach side. The room was very dirty!!! Lots of built up dirt on the floor, in the bathrooms and furniture. OK, I can deal with that, the part that was disapointing was the constant knocking on the door from other guest trying to get into our room. Seems these were..."
"I booked a last minute trip on Dec 24 for a stay from Dec 25-28 2015.I read the most recent reviews for the Sea Mist Resort after I had already booked our reservation. I was nervous after reading reviews about bedbugs. So before we left to go to the hotel, I looked at videos and read articles on how to..."
"My husband and I asked for early check-in (before 4pm) and we weren't able to check in till the latest check-in because our room needed to be inspected. We were also asked to pay more at check-in for ""more taxes."" The staff was a bit rude to us. We paid for an ocean view and was placed in the motel..."
"I really enjoyed myself. Room was nice and clean we stayed in the Tides building. Very economical stay. The oceanfront view was amazing. The only drawback was the big outdoor hot tub was filthy. The water was like cold bath water, and the indoor pool enclosure was stinky."
This is a copy of the email I sent them after my stay. I did not receive a response from the resort.....
The group with us had a very interesting talk about the life and habitat of the sea turtle. The young lady in charge could not be stumped by any question that was asked by the group on the topic.
The sea turtles were amazing! A free look around at these sea turtles were memorizing. Thank you guys for saving these turtles and helping them out! 😃
"Enjoyed visiting the sea turtle sanctuary and learning about these interesting animals. Watched Gerry ,a very large sea turtle, eat his lunch. This organization takes in stranded and wounded turtles. They release them when they are well. Some are not able to be released, thus make their home there."
"Sea Turtle, Inc is a rescue facility. There are numerous tanks with various sea turtles that have been injured and rescued. Some are so severely injured that they would not be able to survive in the wild, so are kept at the rescue facility or adapted out at various aquariums. It's free or feel free to leave a donation, so..."
"We decided to check this place out because the lady at the KOA told us about it, and I'm glad we did. It is so cool to see all of the turtles swimming in the tanks. I love that they are saving the lives of turtles. It was very educational and the kids really got to learn a lot. (So..."
"It's really neat to see all of the different sea turtles that the rescue center has helped! They have one turtle in particular named Alison who had lost a flipper and the staff rigged up a device that attaches to her and helps her to swim. Kind of like the ""Dolphin Tale"" movie but with a sea turtle instead :)..."
The staff was very friendly and informative. You can see the turtles up close and take pictures easily. No admission fee but donations are accepted.
This was my first time to the rescue center. I arrived 15 minutes before the fed the turtles. This was a fun event to watch. The turtles are easy to see. There are signs by each tank explaining the history of the turtles and their prognosis. You can take all the pictures you want. A guide presents a nice 15...
Sea turtles up close. Informative staff. I actually learned a lot. No entrance fee but donations were appreciated.
"A "" must see"" for anyone with a heart and brain. The staff knew plenty if details, and fed them for us. Nice gift shop also. Please make a donation."
"I've been going to a convention at this hotel for the last four years, and every year Daniel Saumell is behind the bar. He not only remembers me and my husband, but he knows Ron is a Bud light guy, and asks us about our grandchildren. He's family to us! It's great to go away and see a familiar face...."
I visited this hotel in late January 2016. I am a frequent visitor to the Orlando area but this is my first time in the SeaWorld area. The lobby of the hotel is beautiful but there are signs of wear and tear with cracked marble and carpet in the hallways that is fraying. The room was above average in size....
"I panicked for a short time when my luggage became missing after checking in for a convention stay. J.V. came to our rescue. He worked diligently to find my luggage. After going to each room that checked in the same time I did, he found my luggage delivered by accident to an empty room. If it weren't for J.V. I..."
"The best location if you are in Orlando to visit SeaWorld, literally across the parking lot. Nice accommodations, clean, comfortable. Massive lobby, very on pointe for large conferences. Food was mediocre, but ok. Staff was very friendly and accommodating."
"I just concluded a 6 night stay here and although the rooms and hotel were nice, everything else was over the top ie drinks, food etc"
I had a challenging stay at the Renaissance Orlando at SeaWorld.
"This is a great property, well-maintained, conveniently located and affordable. The staff are the greatest asset to the Renaissance and each interaction proved it."
"The rooms in this beautiful hotel are spacious and clean. The public areas are very pleasant and staff are friendly. There are two specific points to improve; the signage of parking for guest checking in (we were lost for the first day accessing at least two parking lots) and the quality of catering, which I think can be improved taste-wise."
"nice hotel conveniently located close to I drive attractions, Orlando Eye restaurants etc."
"At suggestion of friends, stopped at the Center while staying on the Island. We were lucky to arrive at a feeding time and the worker was gracious enough to take just the two of us in to watch her feed one of the residents. Also got to see a surgery going on in the operating theater. Workers were extemely knowledge..."
It's a wonderful learning center that teaches how to help and rescue turtles that are in trouble. It also explains how we can do our part to help these endangered species. Great hands-on activities.
The people that work here a fantastic job working with injured and sick sea turtles not only from Georgia but all over the US. See the animals be treated by the staff is something special. Superb!
"Can I just say THANK YOU to all of you working and volunteering your time here. What a fantastic job you do at helping these helpless, injured, beautiful sea turtles. I am so glad I stopped. This is an excellent stop for families as well as adults without kids. It's educational, interactive, and an exemplary example of how we should..."
"My friend and I took the behind the scene tour and was definitely worth the money -- besides, the fee goes toward a good cause. We had a chance to watch the staff clean and stitch up a wound on a turtle's flipper. The work they do to save and rehabilitate injured turtles and terrapins is amazing."
"While we weren't certain what to expect on our visit here, it was all exceeded! First the place is in a historic building that once housed the power plant for the island, which is really cool. Then the place has an above average gift shop, and the people there are just awesome. Great information from the staff, they are all..."
"Not only is the Georgia Sea Turtle Center an educational experience, it's a fun one too. You're given a card after you pay your admission and then you ""journey"" through 5 stations. Your selections determine the lifespan of the turtle, where the nest was laid, etc. There is a hospital that you can visit and see a variety of turtles...."
Bring the kids here! They can visit the gift shop and pick a card that tells a story of a rescue turtle and they can follow his journey.. Of courses they will want to buy something but lots of cute books and educational things to choose from there.
"Fascinating place all about turtles and this place,s efforts to save and protect them.A nice gift shop area with various trinkets and shirts and books."
We visited for the third time and we're surprised at over 20 sea turtles and 3 more coming. We visited the first year and it's amazing how many they have released since then.
"The park was nice and clean, pretty spendy but includes all the rides. Concessions-few were open due to the time of year, no waiting in lines at any of them including the rides. Paid extra for close parking, worth it. Dissaponted in that we didn't have enough time to visit all the attractions due to the reduction in hours due..."
This was our first time at Sea world &amp; what a beautiful day it was. A fun day for all ages . We were there in the first week of December 2015 &amp; even though it was winter we had a beautiful warm sunny day. We arrived at opening time &amp; spent the whole day until closing time . I...
I have loved SeaWorld since I was a child. Was very excited to share it with my family. We went during the week when there were no crowds. Nice relaxing day! Enjoyed learning about all the wonderful animals.
Great day at sea world. We were very taken with the relationship that is obvious between the animals and staff. Killer whale show is a must do.
Every experience was impressive. The staff is super friendly and exceptionally knowledgeable and on brand. I learned so much about conservation and Sea World's commitment to sustainability. Fun for the entire family. We traveled on a Thursday which I highly recommend to avoid lines and be able to absorb the experience fully.
"I love taking my family to SeaWorld because I know it will be a fun day filled with memories. Even more than this, there are plenty of ways to become more informed as to how you can help these wonderful animals."
Our family group of 6 adults and 6 children visited SeaWorld in January. It was quite a cold day so there were not a lot of people My husband and I had visited in August a few years ago and noticed a big difference in attendance. Some of the attractions were closed for renovation and a lot of the eateries...
Lots of attractions to see and well worth the effort.
"My daughter and I spent a day at Sea World while visiting San Diego and had a very good time walking around and checking out the various attractions, shows, and exhibits. It was a bit more expensive than we expected but it was worth it to have that time together."
"This was a fantastic day, the kids loved seeing all the animals and we're excited to go on the rides"
"We loved the grounds and the room. Service wasn't helpful but we counted on the bell staff. Location is next to sea world, but you are completely on your own for getting to and from seaworld.... Staff won't help you.... but the Bell staff might. Expect a line for the concierge. Pool is excellent and well kept. Good food. Rooms..."
I think the for most thing I noticed about the hotel was that the staff were very friendly and we're always ready to help out wit any issues. The room service was also consistent. There was also lots of activities on the grounds to keep one entertained. The hotel is definitely not cheap but it's worth it personally.
Since we arrived everything was amazing. We were treated excellently by everyone front the staff and all of them were very efficient. The rooms were neat and comfortable. The hotel itself is brilliantly designed and the pools are just perfect.
This resort is nothing more than average. After checking in and advising we were not interested in time share we still received the call every morning at 8:20 which I so politely picked up and hung up each time (this is better than having to tell them off!). I'm on vacation I do not want to get a call at...
"So excited to have booked another stay at this fabulous property. We have stayed here twice in the past two years and when booking a trip to Orlando, we could not resist booking here again. We have stayed in both the two bedroom and three bedroom units and both were fabulous. We will be a party of 6 this time..."
"everything was wonderful here. staff, villa, food. couldn't ask for a better family vacation/stay!! beautiful groups, a lot of avtivies, the pools were beautiful. great place for family vacation. lots to do here on the resort."
"We had a 1 bedroom condo for the two of us. We enjoyed our stay. Our condo was a little dark (we looked out on the tropical wooded area near the lake) during the day, but we weren't in it that much. We found the staff very friendly and helpful. Check in was speedy, check out easy. The grounds were..."
"Beautiful complex and well staffed. Ali at the restaurant was attentive, friendly and professional as were other servers when we visited. The team at the convenience store was always on task, friendly and helpful and the store looked fresh and ready each morning. The staff in the lobby were also alert and ready to assist whenever I visited the desks...."
"We stopped at HGV Seaworld Resort for 10 days in December. We travel to Orlando from the UK every year and have done so for over 20 years, so have stayed at a number of properties in the Orlando area. This was the first time we have stayed here and it certainly won't be the last! The whole experience was..."
"I could spend the trip all there. Very nice, beautiful, interesting! There are a lot of things to do and see!!!"
"Great place. Walked here from pier 33 after the Alcatraz tour. Lovely places to eat, great shops and a Zoltar machine ( if your a fan of the film Big)! Great atmosphere, lovely friendly people, you can see the sea lions here also. Lovely way to spend a day"
"We walked pier 39. The best places to eat were right there. We tried several for different finger foods just to taste, we still did not get them all. Fun for the family. The air was cool and fresh."
"Anything you could want is on Pier 39. Great choice of restaurants and other food items, souvenirs and liked the 7D experience"
"Wonderful experience for tourists on a nice sunny day, walking down the pier and taking in all the sights and sounds. Plenty of stores to visit and places to eat."
"It was a fun walk down the pier. Things looked pricey like they always do in tourist traps, but it was still fun to see. the highlight was the sea lions. They were fun to watch and worth the time."
"A great spot to try out while in San Francisco, bustling, full of souvenir shops and restaurants. Make sure to walk all the way to the end as you'll get a great view of Alcatraz and the Golden Gate bridge."
Pier 39 is worth visiting at least once in the day and once the evening when you're in San Francisco. Good food and entertainment at all times.
"If you want to pay for overpriced food, and souvenirs visit Pier 39. There were a lot of other nicer places to visit in San Fran than Pier 39. Definitely go and check it out but then leave quickly."
"Lots to see and do! A great way to enjoy shopping, food and the waterfront. Plenty to do for kids and adults. A short walk from the Ferry Building- walk or take a street car- great spot to spend the better part of a day."
"After having lunch overlooking the cove, we went down to see what was happening. We were surprised to see seals and sea lions basking in the sun and lolling on the beach. We were able to get up close to these animals. An experience not to be missed"
It was fun to see all of the sea lions lounging on the sand and hillside. The waves were really strong due to an incoming storm so there was very little beach to enjoy.
A bit smelly from the birds and animals but a great spot to visit and take photos. Don't approach the seals though...
We sat here for a couple of hours just to catch the sun set. Very lovely. You can park in the streets around. Lots of people walking.
La Jolla cave is a lovely small ocean side park. There are clean restrooms. Sea Lions sun on the rocks and the beach area. You can get close enough for some photos if you are careful not to disturb the wildlife. There is a small sandy beach area and a small cave to explore.
Easily accessible from walkway above. You can look over this colony of Seals and the magnificent ocean views. Love this place!
We really enjoyed our mid-morning stop at the Cove during our January trip to sunny southern California. There are lots of sea lions just laying around sunning themselves.
We walked on La Jolla cove last night just as the sun was setting and witnessed a most beautiful sight. This is the reason we chose to vacation at La Jolla this year. We hope to see many more such sunsets until we reach the sunset of our life.
It was a wonderful experience seeing all the sea lions as well as the Being beautiful.. It's a wonderful stroll with multiple restaurants in and eating outside was magnificent especially with the view ..
"Great bird and seal watching. December through May the beach is closed to people and dogs, as it becomes a seal nursery!"
We are here a few times for dinner and once for breakfast since it was so close to where we were staying. The macadamia crusted mahi mahi was absolutely divine. I had the pasta and was not as impressed for the price. Breakfast there was a lot less expensive and much greater portions. The macadamia banana pancakes were delicious. We...
"We booked a reservation for dinner at this restaurant and we're not disappointed. Though somewhat pricey, the service was excellent and the food delicious. The additional bonus are the views of the beach and small bay. If visiting Maui this should be a restaurant to consider."
Hard to beat the value you get with the Early Bird menu's three choices. Salad and dessert are included for $38. Great views indoor or outside. Just order between 5:30 - 6:00.
Great prime rib and lobster and shrimp Mac and cheese! Best view of the sunset at dinner! Great service and wonderful ambiance!
"Though staying at Napili Kai, we waited until late in our stay to dine just down the hill from our condo. It was worth the wait! The menu was more varied than many in Maui, and be advised there are early bird dining specials for anyone wanting to get in before 6:00 pm. The bar features it's Mai Tais, and..."
Have dinnered here for many years. Missed last year and this year for first time in many restaurant was less than full. Appears happy hour in adjacent area is more active. It was jammed for the hour before dining seating started and then nearly empty. Our food and service not up to prior levels. View continues to be OUTSTANDING
"This is one of our favorite restaurants in Maui. It's about an hour drive from Wailea but well worth it. It is located 30 feet from a beautiful tranquil bay and beach with swimmers, snorkelers and paddle boarders putting on a show! The food was excellent the service friendly, prompt and very good. The view was incredible and the sound..."
Went here for my husband's birthday while on Maui. Food was good and very prompt. Desserts were wonderful.
We stopped here on the recommendation of our front desk hostess at our hotel. We stopped during happy hour and ordered wings and coconut shrimp. The wings were so delicious we ordered another plate. They were cooked nice and crispy just the way we like them. 3 drinks and 3 appies were under 40 dollars. Very reasonably priced with good...
Went there yesterday for Happy hour and had the pork tacos and crab cakes. Very good. Best Happy hour offerings that we have found. Breakfast there today was scrumptious. I had Ail'a which is a baked egg dish and my husband had chocolate macadamia nuts pancakes. Also very good. Enough left over for breakfast tomorrow. Beautiful views of ocean from...
"I really love this place it's far enough away from ocean ave but right I'm the middle of Collins and Washington there's a great 24 hour resturaunt across the street the pool and beach area is so nice and quite the food,service and atmosphere is 5 star the only down side to this and any hotel in a metropolis area..."
"Older art deco hotel on south beach. Beautiful pool and garden area, with back gate to boardwalk and beach. You can rent chairs and/or little cababa covers on the beach."
we arrived a little early and the person at the desk said just give me a few minutes. 20 minutes later I asked her what was going on - she was texting on her phone - oh I will check - and give me a few minutes. About 10 minutes later we had a room - no one offered to...
"OUTSTANDING location. This small hotel on a sliver of prime real estate includes everything you need for a perfect vacation. From the street to the beach: 1) you are greeted by an expert staff who says ""yes"" to your requests, halls are lined with wonderful photos of old Miami Beach, 2) the room is clean and quiet and the bath..."
Great access to ocean
"Couldn't ask for a better location - right on the beach on Collins Ave. Nice pool area, nice access to the beach walk, friendly and helpful staff. Great area. The decor is in need of improvement. But for the price, a great value."
"This hotel is directly on the beach in my favorite part of SoBe - a little north, but still within walking distance, of Ocean Drive. I like being here because you can walk to the madness of Ocean Drive if you want to, but you can also escape it when you want to. The hotel is an older art deco..."
"I have stayed at the South Seas at least a half dozen times. It's a great location in the Heart of South Beach on Collins Ave, walking distance to everything. Nice little pool/bar area out back, steps from the beach with a free chair rental (umbrella is extra). Free Continetal Breakfast each morning until 10am. The rooms are small ,..."
Excellent location for a beach site. Room was just right for 2 people. All staff members greeted us throughout the day with a friendly and professional manner.
this was by far the best excursion we have been on. very funny and informative men telling their fishing stories. eagles galore. nice tiny gift shop on board. comfy seats. snacks were giving to us at end of tour. you do not go out into Bering sea. they stay in inside passage. we felt no waves or rises from water...
This crew was very friendly and helpful. The ship was well equipped with raincoats and galley seating for viewing. The tour was well planned and informative. Guests were encouraged to interact with the animals up close and personal. Restrooms were available as well as hot coco in the gift shop. Would definitely recommend for all ages.
Booked this excursion while on our Alaska cruise. Cheaper to book direct thatn through the cruise line.
"This is a fantastic, must-do tour. The captain and crew all have first-hand experience in sailing and fishing in the dangerous Bering Sea. They have a wealth of knowledge on the sea, boats and the fishing industry, for which they also hold a great passion. Their stories are funny, interesting and often quite moving. They also display great respect for..."
Really enjoyed the tour on the boat and the crew were very informative and fun. The boat was very comfortable and it was very cold they day we did the tour and they supplied lovely warm parker type jackets which made a difference. They explained how the Fisherman on the Deadliest Catch work and the difficulties they face. They had...
This is a must see in Ketchikan! The staff is awesome and very friendly. You get to see lots of wildlife! It's definitely something you have to go see! Your family will be talking about it for years!
This tour was definitely the best of all the excursions that we took on our Alaska cruise.
"entering, educating, thrilling, beautiful, the information supplied by the WHOLE crew was outstanding, the scenery was beautiful, the stop at the eagles just took my breath away there are not enough words to accurately describe the experience of a lifetime with this trip"
"This tour is the best of both worlds. The crew: experienced, lively and full of information and stories about the ups and downs of fishing life. The boat: Workhorse turned comfortable touring rig. Seating on the upper and lower decks (with heating lamps!), hot beverages, and one of the nicer bathrooms on a boat I've ever encountered. The Bering Sea..."
This even was fun and educational. The crew relate d real life experiences they had fishing the Bearing Sea -- Incredible!!!
"It was the highlight of our trip to Kona. When we were there they had high surf advisory and it was the best way to snorkel at ""2 step"". We were so lucky to snorkel there and have 3 turtle sighting. Steve told us the best places to snorkel and he was right on the mark. Captain Cook was fantastic..a..."
"Great trip on Zodiac so not good for seasick prone travelers. Small group experience. Captain Jenna and sidekick Michael were kind, friendly, professional and really knew their stuff! Showed us sights along the way with historical and geological information. This is the best snorkel tour I have been on by far and will definitely do it again!"
The staff and crew are excellent. The directions are easy and there is ample parking near the dock and harbor. All the equipment to snorkel is provided including prescription googles at no extra charge. They use rigid hull inflatable rafts. I am a woman in my 60's and I had no problem riding on the raft or getting in or...
Captain Steve and assistant Kevin were great. We did the South Kona expedition and it was about 5 hrs. On this trip you visit Kealakekua Bay (Captain Cook) &amp; Honaunau Bay. Just to clarify you can visit these sites on your own you can park at Honaunau Bay and you can hike in to Captain Cook however the hike is...
"I have been on several snorkeling adventures, Sea Quest was by far the best. Our boat was a smaller boat with fewer people, 14 was max, but we only had 8-snorklers, which made it even better. Captain Steve was great, very knowledgeable about Hawaiian history, geography, and sea life. We snorkeled in three great places, visited sea caves, saw lava..."
"Amazing crew, great lunch, beautiful boat ride...snorkeling was great even though I got queasy and couldn't fully participate (my fault, not theirs) ...my son had a great time. Crew is very attentive and knowledgeable...highly recommend. ..aloha and mahalo"
"Our 3 stop snorkeling tour was on 1/21. Although the water was a little choppy, Captain Kendra made the trip fantastic. We saw lots of great coral reefs, turtles, and even played with dolphins swimming along with the boat. Our group had some special needs, and they were handled very well. Everyone was made to feel special and welcome. This..."
We had a great time on this trip
I went on two snorkeling trips with Sea Quest and they were both totally fantastic: the three snorkel trip and the mantra ray night snorkel.
"This was our second trip with Sea Quest to Captain Cook Monument. Both trips were excellent. We saw whales and dolphins and had a very nice snorkel. Both trips had wonderful Captains and were not too crowded. On our most recent trip, Kendra was very adept at spotting whales - we saw seven. I would highly recommend this trip to..."
"When you book this be sure to ask for Shawn and CJ! The tour is fun, but these two have a ton of local knowledge and are a blast! The surf was a bit rough, so the snorkeling was only ok, but the rest or the trip made it all worth it anyway. Saw Dolphins, whales, turtles and incredible shoreline..."
"This guys are top notch. Great trip out to snorkel, then up the Napali Coast and back with plenty of whales and dolphins to view on the way. Most important for this review is the crew was awesome. Captain Jeff and company were great. Only thing that was rough on this trip was the waves and a little bit of..."
Snorkel with sea turtles? Check. See whales? Check. Baby whales? Check. Watch spinner dolphins dance around the boat? Check. Bottlenose dolphins on the way back? Check.
Visited Kauai in January 2016 an took this tour. The land staff and crew were fantastic.
"Just finished our Na'Pali cost snorkel tour with Kauai Sea Tours and had a great time. Our captain, Kauai, was both entertaining and knowledgeable, sharing a great deal of information on Kauai spcifically and Hawaii in general. Due to many days of rough water, the visibility at the snorkel location was not great, but was to be expected given the..."
"As our time on Kauai was winding down we had to get out on the water. We had originally booked with Captain Andy's to go up the Na Pali coast for the sunset cruise, but due to the high swells, they changed the tour to the south coast. Kudos to them for giving us a full refund so we could..."
"Went during winter (January) and just happened to pick a great day to go. The ocean was a little rough, but overall very tolerable. The crew made sure everyone was taken care of. We snorkeled for about 45-60 minutes. Saw a few turtles while snorkeling. After the snorkeling, we went to the Na Pali Coast. We saw humpback whales, dolphins,..."
"This 6 hour tour was an amazing trip. The captain and his crew were first rate. While the big catamaran still bounced around in the waves, overall we had great views from the upper deck. We saw dozens of whales, a pod of spinner dolphins, and a ses turtle up close while snorkeling. The kids, 10 &amp;11 had a blast...."
"We took this boat/raft ride up along the Na Pali coast. The sights were really beautiful, we even came upon a pod of spinner dolphins! The trip was a little roughter than expected (although we were warned, but we were given the ""same"" warnings on other tours we took that turned out to be really tame, so take this warning..."
There are several companies to choose from to visit the Napoli coast by boat. We reviewed all of them before we left for the island and selected Kauai Sea Tours as the day and time were the best choice and we weren't disappointed at all with our selection. The trip was awesome and visiting in January we also had the...
"Great place to take kids, and well worth it, but not world class in size, but interesting and fun nevertheless."
"This feels like a 'small town' effort for an aquarium. The exhibits are somewhat repetitive, and for the most part not particularly impressive. There is a smallish area for touching some sea creatures. Little kids probably like it more than older ones. Admission for adult was over $20."
This place is great for kids. They let you touch just about all the animals.
"I really don't know its better than others, I don't go often to aquariums but its really nice to go there with children, they enjoy it very much."
"A nice aquarium - no large fish, but a great environment for kids. We were two adults and the guides were excellent, but the entire environment were really gearded for kids."
"Entry fee is really expensive for this venue and the attractions/exhibits are really average. We've visited several aquariums around the country and was really surprised by how small, expensive and lacking this aquarium felt. I'd skip it and go to Woodland Zoo instead. Currently the location is difficult due to all the construction around it so it really did turn..."
We had so much fun. It was our Anniversary and the last 2 times we had been in Maui and I got a fresh flower lei. Well it was Hawaii days and they were handing them out as we entered. It was perfect. We loved all of the exhibits. We need to go again.
I am from Alask and we have the Alaska Sea Life Center which is amazing but I really enjoyed the Seattle Aquarium. When we walked in we immediately saw a diver inside the huge fish tank in the lobby and it was quite interesting to hear the narrator talking about the feeding time and giving amazing facts about the fish...it...
"There is everything here! I love the otters and sea lions. They are so cute, energetic and fun. My kids loved it!"
"Never actually made it inside. There was a long line in pouring rain. Everyone could have stoop under an overhang alongside the building, but they made you stand in the rain instead. They put up a sign saying also enter using south entry, when I went there the doors were locked and you could not get in that way. I..."
"Stayed here for the first time in Suite 7. Very centrally located to restaurants, downtown &amp; other attractions. The staff was very friendly &amp; welcoming. The view is beautiful, even on a rainy day. The Inn provides a wonderful mini breakfast every morning &amp; binoculars to whale watch! Fairly quiet for having adjoining walls to the suites."
Our first time to Mendocino and couldn't have picked a better place to stay!
"Sea Rock Inn was truly a wonderful experience. The owners were very welcoming, helpful and kind. The breakfast each morning was delicious, they had coffee tea and brownies all day, movies to choose from and lots of travel info. We also had the option of bringing the breakfast to our room which was nice. We stayed in Suite 12 and..."
Just a very peaceful and quiet place to get away from all of the regular daily grinds of life. A place where you can be one with nature and enjoy the beauty of the Pacific Ocean. A great getaway for anniversary or honeymoon or just to rest.
"First off, the Sea Rock Inn is gorgeous. Fantastic view, charming rooms, perfect little getaway. But what really impressed us was how great the staff was: friendly, professional and very helpful. Would definitely come back!"
"Fabulous place - with lovely cottages and lots of thoughtful amenities, perched on a hillside overlooking the ocean. We savored the tasty breakfast while watching the ocean mist receding. The management was friendly and helpful - I highly recommend it!"
"What a great little getaway spot. The views from our room were unbelievable (we were there during the harvest moon so the evening was just as delightful). The service was great (Norman is awesome!), and the food was tasty! The room was great and the bed was cozy. It's located just close enough to walk to down-town (if you're a..."
"We've been coming to the Searock for 20 years now and it is a family tradition for very good reason: it is a truly relaxing and beautiful getaway that we always look forward to, and we have never once been disappointed. We will continue coming here for many years to come!"
"Located on a bluff overlooking the crashing Pacific, the Inn offers guests unrivalled comfort and convenient access to downtown Mendocino in well appointed suites and cottages. We opted for Cottage 10, set beside the lobby and close to the road but equipped with its own parking, practical for unloading large cases."
"We loved this little beach hotel. The room was updated, clean, super comfy bed, loved it so much! The location is literally steps from the beach. There's a boardwalk up and down the beach that goes quite a long way, and is full of walkers, runners, bikes and skateboards, very lively. Great people watching. If we stayed there again we..."
"Our entire experience was wonderful - Blake's friendly and helpful assist with our reservation process; Ashley and other front desk staff being super friendly and helpful (where to eat, how to get our Uber ride, how to use the Mac to print our airline tickets); the always smiling housekeeping staff; and even the quick return by mail of the item..."
"Definitely the best thing about this place is the location, right off the beach, with many great restaurants and bars within walking distance. I was in a room billed as ""partial ocean view,"" but it actually looked directly out across the pool to the ocean (in their picture, taken from the beachwalk, look across the pool to the second floor)...."
"My wife and I came to LA to watch a Lakers game but had two days to kill, decided San Diego wasn't too far away. Briefly looked at some places and saw this one, drove there and walked in to check out rooms and availability. A little skeptical from the outside but had read the place had been renovated and..."
Love this place the staff was very friendly and professional the view is spectacular sunrise and the sunset never wanted to leave easy access to walking to the beach lots of restaurants nearby and shopping the hotel is nice and clean
"So this is an old hotel that has been renovated on the inside. The rooms have an IKEA furnished feel, with some Surf theme art work on the walls. I felt like the hotel is trying its best to keep the old building going by renovating the rooms, but it's hard to overcome the overall shape and age/condition of the..."
"my girlfriend and i had a great stay here. it started out with the awesome front desk service from jeff. room was very nice and clean. we didnt need to drive our car anywhere because this hotel is in the heart of the beach community. i really like staying here,and will be back on my next visit to san diego."
My wife and I passed three days after Christmas at this property. What a great place! We sprung for a beach-side room; the patio looked over the walking path along the Mission Beach with views to the Crystal Pier and constant action. The staff were very helpful and the parking in the garage with elevator access to rooms made it...
"This was our second visit to the Blue Sea. The rooms are clean, the staff is wonderful, it's right on the beach, and the surrounding neighborhood is walkable for dinner, drinks, etc. My husband was there for a conference in San Diego (at the Town and Country in Hotel Circle) and it was very easy to navigate back and forth..."
My husband and I came here for the fried clams. They were yummy. No frills but that's what helps to keep the prices reasonable.
"This is our fifth trip to Hilton Head, and had never found the Sea Shack before. People at our church recommended it, so we had GPS show us where it is. Of course we missed the ""order food before going to a table"" sign, but other diners were courteous enough to fill us in. We found the person taking our..."
"Ate at the Sea Shack based on the reviews on trip adviser during my weeklong stay on Hilton Head in January. Needed a quick bite to eat, got there right at 11:00 during the week before the crowd arrived. Wanted fried fish, I had catfish and my wife had flounder. Well seasoned and cooked. Huge portions, inexpensive. Exactly as advertised."
"Hole in the wall eatery with lackluster staff - but it's the best seafood on island!! If you don't care about service, you won't be disappointed!"
Very good fried seafood but...
"The Sea Shack has no pretensions. It does have great fresh fish, fried, grilled, or blackened. Most of the folks I saw, and I myself, were eating our fish fried."
"Agree with Rob's review! excellent food, prepared and served very simply. Just good seafood at very reasonable prices."
"First off, this is not a fancy place. If you are trying to impress a gorgeous, snooty, drama queen, go somewhere else. There are no white linen tablecloths here. There aren't any waitresses to take your order here (You order at the cook's station, a hairy-armed waiter will deliver your meal to you at your blue and white checkered table,,,,,,,,,..."
Definitely not fine dining. Plastic plates and cutlery. Small with about 10 tables. If you enjoy fish. Chowder etc. you will enjoy the food. No atmosphere or ambiance. Enjoyed the experience for one time.
"Used the carryout service. Service was fast and efficient. Good size portions. Food was excellent. The catfish dinner is very good, will order it again."
"I was reminded of that wonderful line by someone who said, 'people go to Naples because they think they are old and rich but when they get there they realize they are neither'. The restaurant prices reflect the huge amount of disposable income that floods into the town in the winter months. The Sea Salt caters to these people and..."
"Unbelievably bad service. Menu and food were fine but the server basically ruined our meal. Here are the highlights - didn't know anything about the menu, drinks took forever to be ordered and come out, food came out to fast once it came - didn't have time to finish our courses, server placed food down on table then served other..."
"One of the highlights of Salt is the oyster menu- rotating options from all over the world, depending on what is in season."
"Located in Olde Naples, Sea Salt is an excellent choice for lunch, and presumably dinner. I met 2 other friends there for a business lunch. The staff was very helpful and never rushed us even though we sat there for an extra long time to finish up our business. My only complaint was that the caesar salad had too much..."
"Sea Salt has it all. Nice ambience, whether inside or out, and great food and wine. And some nice unique touches."
Lovely setting in the middle of the trendy 3rd St. area. Great seafood - broad selections - had a wonderful swordfish that was melt in the mouth tender (and this dish can be challenging to keep moist and tender). Outstanding wine list - especially Italian and Spanish selections) with knowledgable sommelier. Highly recommended - can be crowded - tables seated...
"We can never get enough fresh local fish and in our opinion Sea Salt is the best in Naples! They start you off with bread, olive oil and three salts from around the world. Fun to compare and try. Today, our favorite was a pink Hawaiian salt but the sulphur salt from India was the most unusual we've had. We..."
"In coming to the US one has to recalibrate, all but a very few restaurants actually serves European aka French standard haute cuisine."
"Went today for lunch. Currently running a special at the bar. A glass of house wine and a burger for only 12.95. In Naples that's a bargain. The burger is usually 14.00 and the wine 10.00. Ok, the usual price is too high BUT on special, it brings it down to MCD range! Oh yea, if you don't like burgers,..."
"Arrived with a reservation for a party of four. Dinner. Everyone of us loved the food. The fish was prepared perfectly. Of everywhere we have eaten in downtown Naples this place surpasses them all. Service great, wine selection good. Ambiance nice. Will take guests here again. One of the few worth the price tag."
"Beautiful setting for intimate wedding. Sage, event planner, was wonderful and flexible with the ever-changing weather. Food so delicious. Very comfy bedding and rooms so peaceful. Wood walkways did make for noisy footsteps, but overall-excellent"
"I love Sea Ranch -- the grounds are beautiful, the rooms are rustic and charming. The beds are super comfortable. It's the staff that makes the place mediocre. Upon checkout they didn't ask how the stay was. I let them know that I'd stayed in the same room 8 months prior, and the heater still made loud noises every time..."
Marvelous find on the North Central Coast
"Great weekend getaway, fantastic setting, amazing property and chill vibe. The staff presents as unhappy and not so helpful but it didn't matter because we got lost in the tranquility surroundings. We will go back."
It was our first time at Sea Ranch. I know it was older but was looking forward to the rustic rooms. We got there in time for a glass of wine and apps. The wines were ok and probably not the right temp. It was $50. The waitress forgot my soup twice as she came to our table for something...
"The lodge has been nicely updated and well maintained since I was last here about 20 years ago. The setting is still spectacularly beautiful, peaceful, and wild -- it's a great place to sit and read, stare at the waves or walk the miles of coastal trails. Best of all, it's a pet-friendly place! The rooms are simply but elegantly..."
"Such a beautiful and peaceful place. I loved the style of the town and of the lodge. This would have been one of our fav hotels except for 2 things: 1) our room had a very, very funky smell that did not subside 2) restaurant left some to be desired, and it's the only option in town."
"Very much enjoyed my stay. I'm not sure that I agree with this review policy requiring 200 characters, I assume I'm almost over that number now; oh, 52 to go. well I definitely enjoyed my stay more than this part of the evaluation."
I've stayed at Sea Ranch now four times and I would definitely go back - the property is a bit dated but it has a fun quaint feel to it and the rooms with fireplaces really add an element to the otherwise rustic feel.
Great aquarium but make sure you make reservations in advance for the feeding frenzy tour. That was the highlight of our visit. You get to go feed the fish before the aquarium opens to the public. Well worth the extra price.
"We used to have memberships to the aquarium and went much more often, but haven't kept it up the last two years. This day we went on a homeschool day and really appreciated the hospitality of the Aquarium staff to all the groups. They were not only welcoming and happy to have our students, but they had extra exhibits from..."
"The Monterey Bay aquarium was one of the best attractions we visited on our trip. This place is quite big, so allow at least 2 hours for a visit, probably more if you are taking children. We were given celebration pins at the front desk when they heard it was our honeymoon, and all the staff offered their congratulations as..."
"The Monterey Bay Aquarium is an amazing resource you should not pass up. There is so much to do, so much to learn and so much to gaze upon that one could spend days there and not see it all. Be aware, it is very crowded most day but especially during the summer months. There are many children running around,..."
"It's expensive however, the fee goes to the preservation of the facility as well as food for the animals and staff who were very friendly and helpful."
"The docents are among the best anywhere. We've been here starting in 1989, sometimes multiple times a year, and EVERY trip, we learn something new."
This place was so beautiful and amazing. The aquarium is not Similar to anything i have seen before. It is a Nice place things are organized and You get information about everything. But Only 3 star because of the price. It is very expensive just for watching.
On this rainy cold day we were not able to visit the aquarium. because I have a small poodle that would be contain in a stroller which I was told pets would not be allowed. The aquarium lost $120 from us.
"This really was above our expectations! It was just a really cool place, so informative on the sea life of the area and trying hard to teach about the hazards of pollution on our environment!"
"Forget about Fisherman's Wharf and go straight here. A world class aquarium with excellent interpretive experiences for all ages. The tickets aren't cheap, but worth every penny. Store your belongings in the lockers across the street from the entrance."
The rooms are always clean and comfortable. I love the fact that it is several little buildings motel like but Best Western Style. So you walk out of your room right outside through beautifully manicured greenery that are tropical like and CA style.
Check in was very slow. We established credit with credit cards and we got this long explanation about how in addition to our room rate we were going to have $75 held on our credit cards for incidentals and damages. Made no sense in this day and age.
"The restaurant and bar were under reconstruction. A meeting room was thus used for the restaurant and another room for the bar. The rooms were clean and well put together. They looked very nice. A free breakfast was not available, but the food in the restaurant was very good and with the very inexpensive rate of the rooms, made the..."
"I stayed at the Best Western Seven Seas in San Diego on a Friday night in January, 2016. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable and the room was clean, comfortable and quiet. I was on the second floor. The original cafe on property was under rennovation. I got a great price on the room through Priceline. It was worth..."
"I stayed here for three nights, I actually just checked out an hour ago, I'm writing this review from the airport. I was in town to visit a few friends last minute and I needed something affordable, but I refuse to stay in a dump. This met both of my demands."
"This hotel served fine for the purposes I needed it for - somewhere to sleep, shower and dress as I left out early in the morning and returned late in the evenings. I decided to stay here based on free parking, the cost but mostly the free cancellation (booked via Expedia). There was a bit of a queue at check-in...."
"We enjoyed our recent stay at this hotel very much. Service and cleanliness were important to us - the hotel met both of those points, and more. The staff at this hotel was very helpful and accommodating, not just to us but also to other guests we noticed - excellent service. We were very comfortable with the room, it was..."
"Nice service, price and beautiful landscaping. Room is nice and clean. Great location and hotel landscape is beautiful especially at night. We come to visit our children often and will continue to stay here every time we come to San Diego."
Spent a couple of nights here during our stay in San Diego. The hotel is well located near attractions and shopping and easily accessible to highways. It is not a new facility but it appears to be cared for. Beautiful grounds with a nice pool area and two hot tubs. Very helpful staff and a clean facility. We were pleased...
"This wasn't bad for the money. It was an authentic luau complete with a stage performance led by the chef with music, native dances, audience participation, incredible acts with fire. Narration by the chef was quite funny at times and kept the audience fully engaged every minute. Sea Life Park itself needs updating."
"We wanted to see a luau and waited until the end of our two week stay in Hawaii. Chief's Luau is totally worth the visit! We booked online and got there in plenty of time. Before the meal they have activities for everyone (spear throwing, fire starting, grass weaving, etc). The meal was amazing, and the entertainment was hilarious and..."
"This was an amazing experience. Although we've been to a few luau before and this is the best, we've just been to a few. But we had the good fortune to sit next to a couple who have been to dozens but this was the first time to this one. They said they've never experienced any even close to as..."
"We had a fabulous evening with our family - best luau every. Extremely entertaining, high energy performers, very interactive. So glad we were able to attend. Ames, Iowa"
Chief's Luau was GREAT! The Chief is a great entertainer and his staff of Polynesian people was fantastic. I advice you to take a trip to the far side of the island for some great entertainment. The food is ok but the show is the greatest with the best views of the island
The show was high energy and brought a smile to your face. The food was tasty and show was excellent. Crowd participation was welcomed but not overdone and the Chief kept it moving along.
Great luau. The chief was a great MC and incorporated some humor into the show.
"The entertainment and setting more than justify the price. The food is only average, hence a 4 and not a 5. Polynesian culture and dance is well presented."
"I visited this attraction in August of 2013 when I got married in Hawaii. I always laugh about my experience here when I look back, but let me tell you, my wife and I were definitely NOT laughing while we in attendance. Quite simply, it was a waste of money."
The show overall was enjoyable. The mc made never ending sexual innuendo through the whole show. It stopped being funny fast and was really inappropriate for all the families present.
"Wonderful hotel...even in the off season - we felt like it was the busy season, as our room was exceptionally clean and the staff was present (our house-keeper was busy about the rooms, the gardener was trimming away expired plants and freshening up the grounds, the office staff was in the office and available) -- yet, it was nice and..."
"After doing a lot of research about where to stay in Cape May, before continuing our trip south by ferry, we finally settled on the Sea Crest because of its great location at one end of the beachfront road, and because of its low off-season price, of just $110 for an oceanview, king bedded room with balcony. Strangely enough, they..."
"No reservations online as far as I know, but the lady who took mine on the phone was very nice as were the ones when I checked in. They told me about the area and what was going on. Had a suite on the 2nd floor that overlooked the pool area and ocean view. Very roomy and clean room. Had..."
"We stayed in late Oct/Nov .. we had an ocean view. The hotel was very clean, the rooms were neatly put together and had what we needed. Our view was wonderful. The people at the desk were very nice. I'm sure summer rates are much higher, but for an off season trip - much cheaper than a B&amp;B and quite..."
"I agree this inn is indeed clean however, our room, one of their most expensive rooms, had a distinct musty, mildewy type odor. We tried opening the windows but like other viewers have mentioned we very quickly had a room filed with cigarette smoke."
"We wanted to book a last minute trip to Cape May, which seemed almost impossible. After looking at a lot of places, I stumbled upon the Sea Crest Motor Inn. From the reservation process to our whole stay, it was great. We loved our comfortable and functional room and can't wait to go back! We both agreed that this is..."
"Clean, comfortable ,relaxing and quiet.5th year going and it only gets better. Staff is very friendly and helpful ,they were spot on with their dining recommendations ,and very concerned that you are enjoying your stay. Calling for reservations is always like calling a friend. Thank-you for making our stay another great memory to cherish."
"We agree with many of the reviews about the positive aspects of Sea Crest Inn: the location, the cleanliness of the rooms, the free parking. The pool and hot tub were great. However, guests are allowed to smoke on the balconies, which are shared, and as a consequence, the smoking of neighbours constantly affected our air, whether we were on..."
"I reviewed the Sea Crest Inn last year, but I am happy to do it again. After visiting this August for my birthday, I continue to enjoy my stay. What's not to love: great location, a pool, and an adult crowd -- perfect for what I'm looking for in a summer getaway with my boyfriend. Everything you need like shopping..."
